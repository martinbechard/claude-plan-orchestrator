# Claude Code Instructions for claude-plan-orchestrator

## Plugin Versioning

This project is a Claude Code plugin. Always treat `plugin.json` version as if the
plugin were published in the marketplace:

- Bump the version in `plugin.json` for every meaningful change (semver: patch for
  fixes, minor for new features, major for breaking changes)
- Update RELEASE-NOTES.md with the new version and a summary of changes
- Never leave the version stale after shipping a feature or fix
