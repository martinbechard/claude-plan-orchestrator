# Slack Feature Request Acknowledgment with Analysis Summary

## Status: Open

## Priority: Medium

## Summary

After completing 5 Whys analysis on a Slack feature request, the system should
post an acknowledgment message summarizing its understanding and stating its next
action (either asking clarifying questions or proceeding with a specific plan).
This creates a checkpoint where the user can verify alignment before significant
work begins.

Currently the Slack workflow jumps directly from analysis to action without
communicating the system's interpretation. Feature development involves
significant time investment, so misalignment early leads to wasted effort.

## Root Need

The user needs a confirmation checkpoint after analysis that demonstrates
comprehension and signals intent, creating a collaborative feedback loop
before committing to implementation work.
