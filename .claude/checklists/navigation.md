# Navigation Checklist

Domain-specific validation rules for navigation and routing features.

## Rules

- All links resolve to valid pages (no 404 errors)
- Back button returns to the previous page
- Breadcrumbs reflect the current location accurately
- Deep links work (direct URL access loads the correct page)
