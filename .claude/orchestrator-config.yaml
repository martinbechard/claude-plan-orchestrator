# Orchestrator configuration for this project.
# Both auto-pipeline.py and plan-orchestrator.py read this file.
# All fields are optional -- defaults are used when omitted.

# Port the dev server runs on. The auto-pipeline stops/restarts it during
# orchestrator runs to avoid build cache conflicts, and the plan-orchestrator
# uses it for post-plan smoke tests.
