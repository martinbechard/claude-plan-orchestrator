If you changed middleware, layout files, or auth-related code: run `npx playwright test tests/SMOKE01-critical-paths.spec.ts --reporter=list` to verify critical paths\n6.

If you changed middleware, layout files, or auth-related code: run `npx playwright test tests/SMOKE01-critical-paths.spec.ts --reporter=list` to verify critical paths\n6. Commit your changes with a descriptive message\n6. Write a status file to `.claude/plans/task-status.json` with this format:\n   ```json\n   {{\n     \"task_id\": \"{task['id']}\",\n     \"status\": \"completed\",  // or \"failed\"\n     \"message\": \"Brief description of what was done or what failed\",\n     \"timestamp\": \"<ISO timestamp>\",\n     \"plan_modified\": false  // set to true if you modified the YAML plan\n   }}\n   ```\n\n## Plan Modification (Optional)\nYou MAY modify the YAML plan file ({plan_path}) if it makes sense:\n- **Split a task** that's too large into smaller subtasks (e.g., 5.2 -> 5.2a, 5.2b)\n- **Add a task** if you discover something missing from the plan\n- **Update descriptions** to be more accurate based on what you learned\n- **Add notes** to tasks with important context\n- **Skip a task** by setting status to \"skipped\" with a reason if it's no longer needed\n\nIf you modify the plan, set \"plan_modified\": true in the status file so the orchestrator reloads it.\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST write the status file before finishing.
