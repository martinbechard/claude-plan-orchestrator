This simplifies configuration and avoids user errors.\n\n2. **EscalationConfig lives on the plan, not per-agent.** While agents have a starting model, the escalation policy (when to escalate, ceiling) is plan-level. This keeps the configuration in one place and avoids conflicting settings across agents in the same plan.\n\n3. **Escalation uses attempt count, not failure type.** The backlog item mentions \"consecutive failures.\" Since the orchestrator already increments task.attempts on each retry, we use that counter directly. All failures are treated equally (no distinction between rate limits, timeouts, or logical failures).\n\n4. **Validation model is a separate override, not part of escalation.** Validators are not subject to escalation because they perform deterministic checks. The validation_model setting gives explicit control.\n\n5. **Model flag passed via --model CLI argument.** The Claude CLI supports --model to override the default model. This is the cleanest integration point.\n\n6. **No agent frontmatter changes required.** The existing model field in agent frontmatter already serves as the starting model. No new fields are needed in agent definitions.\n\n7. **model_used recorded in plan YAML for observability.** After each task attempt, the model used is written into the task dict. This provides an audit trail visible in the plan file.\n\n8. **Backwards compatible when disabled.** When meta.model_escalation is absent or enabled: false, the orchestrator behaves exactly as before (no --model flag is passed, Claude uses its default).\n","numLines":189,"startLine":1,"totalLines":189}}}
