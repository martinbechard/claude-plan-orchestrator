Reads the plan file, picks the next uncompleted task, implements changes, runs tests, writes status file, and marks task complete.\nallowed-tools: Bash, Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep, Task\n---\n\n# Implementation Agent Skill\n\n## Purpose\n\nThis skill executes implementation tasks from YAML plan files. It:\n1. Reads the plan to find the next uncompleted task\n2. Reads relevant architecture and design documents\n3. Implements the changes following project coding rules\n4. Runs tests and build to verify\n5. Writes a status file for the orchestrator\n6. Commits changes after completion\n7. Marks the task as complete in the plan\n\n## Usage\n\nInvoke with: `/implement` or `/implement [task id]`\n\n## YAML Plans\n\nYAML plans live in `.claude/plans/` and are executed by `scripts/plan-orchestrator.py`.\n\n**To run automated execution:**\n\nIMPORTANT: Always launch the orchestrator as a background Bash task using `run_in_background: true`\nso it appears in the Claude Code task list. Then monitor it periodically by checking the YAML plan\nfor task status updates. Never launch with shell `&` --- it won't be tracked.\n\n```bash\n# Run all pending tasks sequentially (use run_in_background: true)\npython scripts/plan-orchestrator.py --plan .claude/plans/<plan-name>.yaml\n\n# Run with parallel task execution (uses git worktrees)\npython scripts/plan-orchestrator.py --plan .claude/plans/<plan-name>.yaml --parallel\n\n# Run single task then stop\npython scripts/plan-orchestrator.py --plan .claude/plans/<plan-name>.yaml --single-task\n\n# Resume from specific task\npython scripts/plan-orchestrator.py --plan .claude/plans/<plan-name>.yaml --resume-from 4.7\n\n# Dry run to preview execution order\npython scripts/plan-orchestrator.py --plan .claude/plans/<plan-name>.yaml --dry-run\n\n# Verbose with real-time streaming\npython scripts/plan-orchestrator.py --plan .claude/plans/<plan-name>.yaml --verbose\n```\n\n**Monitoring the Orchestrator:**\n\nAfter launching the orchestrator in the background, check on progress periodically:\n\n```bash\n# Quick status: show non-completed tasks\ngrep -E '(status:|id:)' .claude/plans/<plan>.yaml | paste - - | grep -v completed\n\n# Check if orchestrator process is alive\npgrep -f \"plan-orchestrator\"\n\n# Check child Claude processes\npgrep -P <orchestrator-pid>\n\n# Check current task status file\ncat .claude/plans/task-status.json\n```\n\nCheck every 2-3 minutes during active execution. Report progress to the user when tasks\ncomplete or if the orchestrator encounters errors (circuit breaker, rate limits, failures).\n\n**Graceful Stop:**\nTo stop the orchestrator without killing the current task, create a semaphore file:\n```bash\ntouch .claude/plans/.stop\n```\nThe orchestrator checks for this file before starting each new task. The current task\nwill finish normally, then the orchestrator will exit cleanly. The semaphore file is\nautomatically cleaned up on the next orchestrator start, so a stale file from a\nprevious run will not block a new run.\n\n**YAML Plan Structure:**\n```yaml\nmeta:\n  name: Feature Name\n  description: What this plan accomplishes\n  plan_doc: docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-feature-design.md\n  created: 'YYYY-MM-DD'\n  max_attempts_default: 3\n  notification_email: user@example.com\nsections:\n- id: phase-1\n  name: Phase Name\n  status: pending  # pending | in_progress | completed | failed\n  tasks:\n  - id: '1.1'\n    name: Task Name\n    status: pending\n    description: What this task does\n    depends_on: ['0.4']           # optional, task IDs that must complete first\n    parallel_group: 'group-name'  # optional, tasks with same group run in parallel\n    exclusive_resources:           # optional, prevents parallel with same resource\n    - database\n    max_attempts: 3               # optional, overrides default\n    execution_mode: agent_team    # optional, use agent team for this task\n    team_roles:                   # optional, roles for agent team\n    - name: role-name\n      focus: \"What this role does\"\n```\n\n**Task Fields:**\n- `id` - Unique identifier (e.g., '1.1', '2.3a')\n- `name` - Short task name\n- `status` - pending | in_progress | completed | failed | skipped\n- `description` - Detailed description (include \"Files:\" for conflict detection)\n- `depends_on` - List of task IDs that must complete before this task can start\n- `parallel_group` - Tasks with the same group execute concurrently (requires `--parallel`)\n- `exclusive_resources` - Resources that can't be shared (e.g., ['database', 'config'])\n- `max_attempts` - Override default retry count\n- `execution_mode` - Set to `agent_team` for collaborative tasks\n- `team_roles` - Define roles when using agent team execution\n\n## Choosing Task Execution Strategy\n\nThe orchestrator drives execution. When designing a YAML plan, decide the execution\nstrategy for each task based on whether agents need to communicate:\n\n| Strategy | YAML Config | When to Use |\n|----------|-------------|-------------|\n| Single agent (default) | No special fields | Most tasks: one agent, one focused job |\n| Independent parallel | `parallel_group` | Tasks touch different files, no coordination needed |\n| Design competition | `parallel_group` + judge task | Multiple approaches to evaluate (see below) |\n| Agent team | `execution_mode: agent_team` | Tasks require inter-agent discussion and collaboration |\n\n**Decision guide for each task in the plan:**\n1. Can this task be done by one agent in isolation? -> Single agent (default)\n2. Can multiple tasks run at the same time without talking to each other? -> `parallel_group`\n3. Are there multiple valid approaches that should be explored? -> Design competition\n4. Do agents need to discuss interfaces, challenge assumptions, or coordinate? -> Agent team\n\n## Parallel Execution\n\nWhen `--parallel` is enabled, tasks with the same `parallel_group` field execute concurrently:\n- Each parallel task runs in its own git worktree (`.worktrees/` directory)\n- Results are merged back to main branch after all parallel tasks complete\n- The orchestrator automatically detects file conflicts from task descriptions\n- Tasks with conflicts fall back to sequential execution\n\n**Parallel Coordination (Automatic):**\nThe orchestrator extracts file paths from task descriptions and validates that parallel\ntasks don't conflict:\n- Files mentioned after \"Files:\" or \"New:\" are tracked\n- Paths matching patterns like `src/.../*.tsx` are detected\n- If two tasks in the same `parallel_group` modify the same file, they run sequentially\n\n**Exclusive Resources:**\nFor non-file resources that can't be shared (e.g., database schemas, global state):\n```yaml\n- id: '2.1'\n  name: Run database migration\n  parallel_group: 'phase-2'\n  exclusive_resources: ['database', 'prisma-schema']\n```\nTasks declaring the same exclusive resource cannot run in parallel.\n\n**Writing Good Task Descriptions for Parallel Execution:**\nInclude file paths in descriptions to enable automatic conflict detection:\n```yaml\ndescription: |\n  Add user search to the assignment panel.\n  Files: src/components/community/UserAssignments.tsx\n  New: src/components/community/UserSearchInput.tsx\n```\n\n## Design Competitions (Phase 0 Pattern)\n\nFor features with multiple valid approaches (especially UI), use the design competition\npattern. Five parallel agents each explore a different approach, then a judge picks the best:\n\n```yaml\n- id: phase-0\n  name: 'Phase 0: Design Generation & Evaluation'\n  tasks:\n  - id: '0.1'\n    name: Generate Design 1 - Approach A\n    parallel_group: phase-0-designs\n    description: |\n      Create a detailed design using approach A.\n      CONTEXT: [key source files, design overview with eval criteria]\n      DESIGN CONCEPT: [unique visual/architectural approach]\n      OUTPUT: Write ONLY to docs/plans/feature-design-1-approach-a.md\n  - id: '0.2'\n    name: Generate Design 2 - Approach B\n    parallel_group: phase-0-designs\n    # ... same context, different concept, different output file\n  # ... designs 3, 4, 5\n  - id: '0.6'\n    name: Judge and select best design\n    depends_on: ['0.1', '0.2', '0.3', '0.4', '0.5']\n    description: |\n      Read all 5 designs. Score each on 5 criteria (10 pts each, 50 total).\n      Declare winner. List 2-3 improvements from runner-ups to incorporate.\n      Update the design overview doc with scoring table and final design.\n  - id: '0.7'\n    name: Extend plan with implementation tasks\n    depends_on: ['0.6']\n    description: |\n      Read winning design. Append implementation phases to THIS YAML.\n      Set plan_modified: true in status file so orchestrator reloads.\n```\n\nThe AI judge validates the design; no human review is needed. The human only intervenes\nif the circuit breaker trips or smoke tests fail during implementation.\n\n## Agent Teams (Collaborative Tasks)\n\nAgent teams let multiple Claude Code instances communicate with each other via messages\nwhile sharing a task list. The orchestrator spawns the team; agents collaborate in real-time.\n\n**Agent teams are the right choice when:**\n- Tasks touch related or overlapping code and agents need to coordinate interfaces\n- Debugging requires competing hypotheses that agents should discuss and challenge\n- Cross-layer changes span frontend, backend, and tests with interface contracts to agree on\n- Design reviews benefit from agents critiquing each other's approaches\n- Code review needs multiple focused perspectives (security, performance, test coverage)\n\n**Agent teams are NOT the right choice when:**\n- Tasks are fully independent (use `parallel_group` instead)\n- Only the result matters, not the process (use subagents instead)\n- Tasks are sequential with dependencies (use orchestrator sequential)\n- The work is simple enough for a single agent session\n\n**How agent teams work:**\n1. The orchestrator (or lead session) creates the team with `TeamCreate`\n2. Teammates are spawned via `Task` tool with `team_name` and `name` parameters\n3. Teammates communicate via `SendMessage` (direct messages or broadcast)\n4. All agents share a task list (`TaskCreate`, `TaskList`, `TaskUpdate`)\n5. Teammates self-claim unblocked tasks or the lead assigns them\n6. When done, the lead sends `shutdown_request` to each teammate, then `TeamDelete`\n\n**Configuring agent team tasks in YAML plans:**\n\nUse `execution_mode: agent_team` and `team_roles` to define how the orchestrator should\nset up the team for a task:\n```yaml\n- id: '3.1'\n  name: Implement auth middleware + API endpoint + integration test\n  status: pending\n  execution_mode: agent_team\n  team_roles:\n    - name: backend-dev\n      focus: \"Implement auth middleware and service layer\"\n    - name: api-dev\n      focus: \"Implement API endpoint consuming the middleware\"\n    - name: test-dev\n      focus: \"Write integration tests as the API stabilizes\"\n  description: |\n    These tasks are tightly coupled - the API depends on middleware interfaces,\n    and tests depend on both. Use an agent team so agents can discuss interface\n    contracts and unblock each other in real-time.\n```\n\n**Best practices for agent teams:**\n- Give each teammate enough context in their spawn prompt (they don't inherit conversation history)\n- Size tasks appropriately: 5-6 tasks per teammate keeps everyone productive\n- Avoid two teammates editing the same file simultaneously (coordinate via messages)\n- Use `delegate` mode on the lead (Shift+Tab) to prevent it from implementing instead of coordinating\n- Monitor progress and redirect approaches that aren't working\n- Start with research/review teams before attempting parallel implementation teams\n\n**Token cost consideration:**\nAgent teams are the most expensive execution strategy. Each teammate is a full Claude instance.\nUse them when the collaboration value justifies the cost (debugging, cross-layer coordination,\ndesign critiques) and prefer cheaper strategies (parallel_group, single agent) for independent work.\n\n## Workflow for YAML Plans\n\n### Step 1: Check for YAML Plan\n\nLook for active YAML plans in `.claude/plans/`:\n```bash\nls -la .claude/plans/*.yaml\n```\n\n### Step 2: Find Next Task\n\nRead the plan and find the first task with `status: pending` or `status: in_progress`.\n\n### Step 2b: Check Backlog Dependencies\n\nBefore executing, verify the backlog item's dependencies are satisfied:\n1. Identify the plan's backlog slug from the YAML filename (e.g. `02-blog-publishing-system.yaml` -> `02-blog-publishing-system`)\n2. Find the matching `.md` file in `docs/feature-backlog/` or `docs/defect-backlog/`\n3. Parse the `## Dependencies` section for lines matching `NN-slug-name.md`\n4. Check if each dependency slug exists in `docs/feature-backlog/completed/` or `docs/defect-backlog/completed/`\n5. If any are missing, log a visible warning:\n   `WARNING: This plan has unsatisfied backlog dependencies: [list of missing slugs]`\n6. Continue execution (the human/orchestrator decided to run it), but ensure the warning is visible\n\n### Step 3: Read Context\n\nBefore implementing, ALWAYS read:\n1. The project's coding rules: `CODING-RULES.md` (in the project root)\n2. The `plan_doc` referenced in meta - detailed design\n3. Relevant architecture and design documents\n\n### Step 4: Implement Changes\n\n- Follow the project's coding standards\n- Use existing patterns from the codebase\n- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones\n\n### Step 5: Verify Changes\n\nRun the project's build and test commands to verify no errors:\n```bash\n# Example (adapt to your project):\nnpm run build\nnpm test\n```\n\n### Step 6: Write Status File\n\n**CRITICAL**: Write status to `.claude/plans/task-status.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"task_id\": \"4.7\",\n  \"status\": \"completed\",\n  \"message\": \"Brief description of what was done\",\n  \"timestamp\": \"2026-01-19T12:00:00Z\",\n  \"plan_modified\": false\n}\n```\n\nFor failures:\n```json\n{\n  \"task_id\": \"4.7\",\n  \"status\": \"failed\",\n  \"message\": \"What went wrong and why\",\n  \"timestamp\": \"2026-01-19T12:00:00Z\",\n  \"plan_modified\": false\n}\n```\n\n### Step 7: Commit Changes\n\n```bash\ngit add -A\ngit commit -m \"feat: Task description\n\n- What changed\n- Why it changed\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\"\n```\n\n### Step 8: Update Plan (if not using orchestrator)\n\nIf running manually (not via orchestrator), update the task status in the YAML:\n```yaml\n- id: '4.7'\n  status: completed\n  completed_at: '2026-01-19T12:00:00'\n  result_message: Brief description\n```\n\n## Plan Modification\n\nYou MAY modify the YAML plan if needed:\n- **Split a task** that's too large (e.g., 5.2 -> 5.2a, 5.2b)\n- **Add a task** if something is missing\n- **Skip a task** by setting `status: skipped` with a reason\n- **Add notes** with important context\n\nIf you modify the plan, set `plan_modified: true` in the status file.\n\n## Important Rules\n\n1. ALWAYS read `CODING-RULES.md` before generating code\n2. Fix ALL test failures before marking complete\n3. If build fails, fix the errors before proceeding\n4. Keep changes minimal and focused on the task\n5. ALWAYS write the status file when done\n6. COMMIT after completing each task\n\n## Error Handling\n\nIf the task fails:\n1. Write status file with `status: failed` and clear message\n2. Document what went wrong\n3. The orchestrator will retry (up to max_attempts)\n4. After max attempts, the circuit breaker will trip and the human can investigate\n\n## Creating New YAML Plans\n\nTo create a new plan:\n1. Write detailed design to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-feature-design.md`\n2. Create YAML plan in `.claude/plans/<feature>.yaml`\n3. Reference the design doc in `meta.plan_doc`\n4. Break work into sections and tasks\n5. For UI features or other complex architecture questions where multiple valid approaches\n   exist, consider using the Phase 0 design competition pattern. This is especially valuable\n   when the team needs to explore different UX layouts, API designs, data model strategies,\n   or component architectures before committing to an implementation. Five parallel agents\n   each develop a distinct approach, then an AI judge scores them on predefined criteria\n   and selects the winner --- removing the bottleneck of human design review while still\n   ensuring quality through structured evaluation. The winning design feeds directly into\n   the implementation phases via the self-extending plan pattern.\n6. Run orchestrator to execute\n\nExample command to start:\n```bash\npython scripts/plan-orchestrator.py --plan .claude/plans/my-feature.yaml --dry-run\n```\n","numLines":420,"startLine":1,"totalLines":420}}}

File Headers and Design Traceability\n    12→\n    13→- **RULE:** Every source file MUST include a header comment with:\n    14→  - File path (relative to project root)\n    15→  - One-line summary of the file's purpose\n    16→  - Reference to the design document that defines its behavior (if one exists)\n    17→  - **BECAUSE:** Headers create an explicit link between implementation and specification,\n    18→    preventing architectural drift.\n    19→  - **BECAUSE:** When an AI agent picks up a task in a fresh session, the header tells it\n    20→    where to find the design context without searching.\n    21→\n    22→- **RULE:** Before modifying existing code, ALWAYS verify changes against the design document\n    23→  referenced in the header. If there is a discrepancy, raise the issue rather than silently\n    24→  diverging.\n    25→  - **BECAUSE:** Ensures implementation continues to align with the agreed-upon specification.\n    26→  - **BECAUSE:** Catches unintended deviations early, before they cascade.\n    27→\n    28→- **RULE:** Major design changes or significant refactorings MUST be discussed and approved\n    29→  before implementation.\n    30→  - **BECAUSE:** Prevents costly rework if changes are later deemed undesirable.\n    31→  - **BECAUSE:** In an orchestrated plan, one agent's unauthorized design change can break\n    32→    assumptions held by subsequent tasks.\n    33→\n    34→- **RULE:** Design documents are the single source of truth for module behavior. When changing\n    35→  code, the corresponding design doc MUST be updated to reflect the changes. Conversely, when\n    36→  code seems incorrect, consult the design doc to understand the intended behavior.\n    37→  - **BECAUSE:** Synchronized design and code reduces confusion and prevents drift.\n    38→  - **BECAUSE:** Design documents provide essential context for recovering intended behavior.\n    39→\n    40→- **RULE:** After implementing changes and ensuring tests pass, ALWAYS perform a code review\n    41→  (manual or automated) against the project's standards.\n    42→  - **BECAUSE:** Code reviews catch issues that tests cannot: readability, maintainability,\n    43→    adherence to conventions, and subtle logic errors.\n    44→\n    45→## 1. Naming Conventions\n    46→\n    47→- **RULE:** Follow your language's community conventions consistently:\n    48→  - **PascalCase** for classes, interfaces, type definitions, React components\n    49→  - **camelCase** for variables, functions, methods, utility files\n    50→  - **ALL_CAPS_SNAKE_CASE** for manifest constants (values that never change at runtime)\n    51→  - **kebab-case** for configuration files and non-code assets\n    52→  - **BECAUSE:** Predictable naming reduces cognitive load. You can tell a file's purpose\n    53→    from its casing alone.\n    54→\n    55→- **RULE:** File names containing a single primary class or component MUST be named to match\n    56→  that class (e.g., `StatusManager.ts` for class `StatusManager`).\n    57→  - **BECAUSE:** Creates a predictable mapping between the artifact and the filesystem,\n    58→    reducing time spent searching for definitions.\n    59→\n    60→- **RULE:** Variable, function, and method names MUST be clear, descriptive, and reflect their\n    61→  purpose. Avoid cryptic abbreviations or overly generic names (e.g., `data`, `manager`, `temp`).\n    62→  - **BECAUSE:** The name itself should convey intent and nature, reducing the need for\n    63→    comments and preventing ambiguity.\n    64→\n    65→- **RULE:** Function/method names SHOULD indicate their purpose through word choice:\n    66→  - **Nouns/noun phrases** for functions that retrieve without side effects:\n    67→    `orderCount`, `getUserProfile`, `isActive`\n    68→  - **Verbs/verb phrases** for functions that alter state or perform actions:\n    69→    `updateStatus`, `calculateTotal`, `saveConfiguration`\n    70→  - **BECAUSE:** Signals to the reader whether calling the function might change system state.\n    71→    This is the Command-Query Separation principle.\n    72→\n    73→- **RULE:** Avoid variable names that are easily confused (e.g., `orderCount` vs `orderCounts`\n    74→  for different concepts). Be precise.\n    75→  - **BECAUSE:** Subtle naming differences for distinct concepts lead to hard-to-find bugs.\n    76→\n    77→- **RULE:** Naming conventions MUST be applied consistently across the entire codebase.\n    78→  - **BECAUSE:** A uniform style makes the codebase feel cohesive and easier to navigate.\n    79→\n    80→## 2. File Organization and Imports\n    81→\n    82→- **RULE:** Organize files into standard top-level directories based on their category:\n    83→  - `src/` - All primary source code\n    84→  - `scripts/` - Utility scripts for build, deployment, development tasks\n    85→  - `docs/` - Documentation, design documents, plans\n    86→  - `test/` or `tests/` - Test code, mocks, fixtures\n    87→  - **BECAUSE:** Establishes a conventional structure that makes it easy to locate artifacts\n    88→    and clearly separates source from supporting files.\n    89→\n    90→- **RULE:** Separate shared contracts from implementation:\n    91→  - Shared interfaces/types/constants should live in dedicated directories\n    92→    (e.g., `src/interfaces/`, `src/types/`, `src/constants/`)\n    93→  - Items used only within a single module may remain co-located in that module\n    94→  - **BECAUSE:** Centralizing shared contracts improves discoverability and prevents\n    95→    scattering definitions across modules.\n    96→  - **BECAUSE:** Clearly separates public API contracts from internal implementation details.\n    97→\n    98→- **RULE:** Any single source file exceeding 200 lines SHOULD be refactored into a module\n    99→  folder with an entry point (`index.ts`, `__init__.py`, etc.) that exports only the\n   100→  public API.\n   101→  - **BECAUSE:** Prevents excessively long files that are hard to read, understand, and maintain.\n   102→  - **BECAUSE:** Enforces a clear public API for each component.\n   103→\n   104→- **RULE:** Module entry points (e.g., `index.ts`) MUST only contain import/export statements.\n   105→  No implementation logic.\n   106→  - **BECAUSE:** The entry point defines the public contract. Mixing in logic blurs the boundary.\n   107→\n   108→- **RULE:** Each exported class SHOULD reside in its own distinct file.\n   109→  - **BECAUSE:** One file, one purpose. Makes code review and maintenance simpler.\n   110→\n   111→- **RULE:** Test files MUST mirror the source directory structure.\n   112→  - **EXAMPLE:** Tests for `src/services/workflow/Executor.ts` go in\n   113→    `test/services/workflow/Executor.test.ts`.\n   114→  - **BECAUSE:** Clear, predictable relationship between code and its tests.\n   115→\n   116→- **RULE:** Before creating a new file for a type, interface, or class, check whether a\n   117→  suitable definition already exists. If it does, import it. If it does not, create it in\n   118→  the correct location and register it in whatever central registry the project uses.\n   119→  - **BECAUSE:** Prevents duplication and ensures a single source of truth for definitions.\n   120→\n   121→- **RULE:** Organize imports logically: external libraries first, then project-level aliases,\n   122→  then relative imports. Remove all unused imports.\n   123→  - **BECAUSE:** Consistent organization improves readability and makes dependencies clearer.\n   124→  - **BECAUSE:** Unused imports clutter code and can cause confusion during refactoring.\n   125→\n   126→- **RULE:** Actively avoid and resolve circular dependencies between modules.\n   127→  - **BECAUSE:** Circular dependencies cause runtime errors, make code harder to test,\n   128→    and hinder modularity. Separating contracts into shared directories can break cycles.\n   129→\n   130→## 3. Code Structure and Readability\n   131→\n   132→- **RULE:** Methods SHOULD NOT exceed 30-40 lines. Extract complex logic into helper methods.\n   133→  - **BECAUSE:** Shorter methods are easier to understand, test, and maintain. They tend to\n   134→    have a single responsibility.\n   135→\n   136→- **RULE:** Classes SHOULD NOT exceed 300 lines. If a class grows beyond this, refactor into\n   137→  a module folder.\n   138→  - **BECAUSE:** Large classes often violate the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and\n   139→    are hard to manage.\n   140→\n   141→- **RULE:** Functions accepting more than two parameters MUST use a parameter object.\n   142→  Name the type descriptively (e.g., `CreateUserParams`, `SearchOptions`).\n   143→  - **BECAUSE:** Parameter objects improve readability and maintainability, especially when\n   144→    adding or removing parameters.\n   145→\n   146→- **RULE:** Prioritize code clarity and correctness over premature abstraction. Apply\n   147→  abstractions when patterns are clear, not speculatively.\n   148→  - **BECAUSE:** Maintainability and understandability come first. Three similar lines are\n   149→    better than a premature abstraction that nobody understands.\n   150→\n   151→- **RULE:** Focus on minimal, necessary changes to achieve the goal. Avoid over-engineering.\n   152→  - **BECAUSE:** Simpler solutions are easier to understand, test, and maintain.\n   153→  - **BECAUSE:** Minimizing scope reduces the risk of unintended side effects.\n   154→  - **BECAUSE:** In orchestrated plans, each task should do one thing well. Gold-plating\n   155→    delays the plan and introduces risk.\n   156→\n   157→## 4. Types and Type Safety\n   158→\n   159→- **RULE:** Never use `any` as a type. Always create proper types for groups of fields.\n   160→  TypeScript is all about types; using `any` defeats the purpose.\n   161→  - **BECAUSE:** `any` bypasses all type checking, hiding bugs that the compiler would\n   162→    otherwise catch.\n   163→\n   164→- **RULE:** Use the correct construct for the purpose:\n   165→  - `interface` for contracts that classes can implement or objects must adhere to\n   166→  - `type` for data shapes, function signatures, unions, intersections\n   167→  - `class` when behavior (methods), internal state, or inheritance is required\n   168→  - **BECAUSE:** Choosing the right construct signals intent and makes the code self-documenting.\n   169→\n   170→- **RULE:** Avoid \"Primitive Obsession.\" Use specific types instead of raw primitives\n   171→  (`string`, `number`, `boolean`) to represent domain concepts.\n   172→  - **EXAMPLE:** Use `type UserId = string` or `type Currency = 'USD' | 'EUR' | 'GBP'`\n   173→    instead of bare strings.\n   174→  - **BECAUSE:** Domain-specific types improve type safety, self-documentation, and\n   175→    centralize validation logic.\n   176→\n   177→- **RULE:** Groups of primitives that are always used together SHOULD be encapsulated in\n   178→  an interface or type.\n   179→  - **BECAUSE:** Improves cohesion and makes the relationship explicit.\n   180→\n   181→- **RULE:** Use type assertions (`as any`, `as unknown as Type`) sparingly, with\n   182→  justification. Fix underlying type mismatches instead.\n   183→  - **BECAUSE:** Type assertions bypass safety and can hide bugs.\n   184→\n   185→- **RULE:** Never pepper code with literal constants. Use manifest constants defined at the\n   186→  top of the file (or in a constants module) for any numeric or string value that has meaning.\n   187→  - **BECAUSE:** Magic numbers and strings are cryptic, error-prone, and hard to update.\n   188→  - **BECAUSE:** Constants with descriptive names make code self-documenting.\n   189→\n   190→## 5. Coupling and Cohesion\n   191→\n   192→- **RULE:** Classes MUST have a single, well-defined responsibility (Single Responsibility\n   193→  Principle / SRP). Each class should have one reason to change.\n   194→  - **BECAUSE:** High cohesion makes classes easier to understand, test, and maintain.\n   195→\n   196→- **RULE:** Methods MUST perform a single logical operation.\n   197→  - **BECAUSE:** Single-purpose methods are more readable and testable.\n   198→\n   199→- **RULE:** Minimize coupling between modules. Depend on interfaces rather than concrete\n   200→  implementations, especially across module boundaries.\n   201→  - **BECAUSE:** Loose coupling makes the system more flexible and resilient to change.\n   202→\n   203→- **RULE:** Do not access private members of other classes. Interact through the public API.\n   204→  - **BECAUSE:** Violating encapsulation creates tight coupling that breaks when internals change.\n   205→\n   206→- **RULE:** Avoid \"Feature Envy.\" If a method mostly operates on another class's data,\n   207→  move it to that class.\n   208→  - **BECAUSE:** Improves cohesion and reduces coupling.\n   209→\n   210→- **RULE:** Utility functions used by only one class SHOULD be private to that class or\n   211→  its module, not exported globally.\n   212→  - **BECAUSE:** Keeps related logic together and avoids polluting the module scope.\n   213→\n   214→## 6. Error Handling\n   215→\n   216→- **RULE:** Avoid empty `catch` blocks. Always log the error or re-throw appropriately.\n   217→  - **BECAUSE:** Empty catches silently swallow errors, hiding problems that compound over time.\n   218→\n   219→- **RULE:** Do not use exceptions for normal control flow. Use conditional logic instead.\n   220→  - **BECAUSE:** Misusing exceptions is inefficient and obscures the actual logic.\n   221→\n   222→- **RULE:** Provide clear, informative error messages that include context (what was being\n   223→  attempted, what values were involved).\n   224→  - **BECAUSE:** Good error messages cut debugging time from hours to minutes.\n   225→\n   226→- **RULE:** When logging, always include variable names alongside values:\n   227→  `log(\"Failed to process order: orderId=${orderId}, status=${status}\")`\n   228→  - **BECAUSE:** Knowing which variable holds which value makes trace logs dramatically\n   229→    easier to read.\n   230→\n   231→- **RULE:** When troubleshooting unexpected values, consider whether the variable name is\n   232→  misleading. Rename for clarity if so.\n   233→  - **BECAUSE:** Clear naming aids debugging by making intent explicit.\n   234→\n   235→## 7. Comments and Documentation\n   236→\n   237→- **RULE:** Every exported function, interface, type, class, and global variable MUST have\n   238→  a doc comment (JSDoc, docstring, etc.) explaining its purpose.\n   239→  - **BECAUSE:** Documentation alongside the code improves understanding and maintainability.\n   240→\n   241→- **RULE:** Write comments to explain _why_, not _what_. The code should explain the what.\n   242→  Focus on rationale, business rules, workarounds, and non-obvious decisions.\n   243→  - **BECAUSE:** The \"why\" is context that code alone cannot convey.\n   244→\n   245→- **RULE:** Remove commented-out code. That's what version control is for.\n   246→  - **BECAUSE:** Commented code is noise that becomes outdated and confusing.\n   247→\n   248→- **RULE:** Ensure comments are accurate and up-to-date. Fix or remove misleading ones.\n   249→  - **BECAUSE:** An incorrect comment is worse than no comment.\n   250→\n   251→- **RULE:** Avoid excessive comments. If you feel the need to comment heavily, refactor\n   252→  the code for clarity instead (better naming, smaller functions, clearer structure).\n   253→  - **BECAUSE:** Self-documenting code is preferred. Comments that restate the obvious add\n   254→    clutter.\n   255→\n   256→- **RULE:** Remove development-phase comments (TODO, FIXME, attribution) before task\n   257→  completion. Use task trackers and commit messages instead.\n   258→  - **BECAUSE:** Stale TODOs accumulate as noise. The orchestrator's YAML plan is the\n   259→    proper place to track remaining work.\n   260→\n   261→## 8. Conditional Logic\n   262→\n   263→- **RULE:** Avoid large `switch` statements or long `if/else if/else` chains.\n   264→  - **BECAUSE:** Hard to read, maintain, and extend. Often violates the Open-Closed Principle.\n   265→\n   266→- **RULE:** Consider polymorphism (via interfaces) or lookup maps/objects instead of\n   267→  complex conditionals.\n   268→  - **BECAUSE:** Leads to cleaner, more extensible, and testable designs.\n   269→\n   270→## 9. UI Feedback Patterns\n   271→\n   272→- **RULE:** Before implementing success/error notifications in a component, check for\n   273→  existing toast, notification, or alert components in the project's UI library.\n   274→  - **BECAUSE:** Reusing the existing notification system ensures visual consistency and UX\n   275→    quality.\n   276→  - **BECAUSE:** Inline state-based message divs (`{error && <div>...</div>}`) create\n   277→    visual inconsistency, shift content, and require manual cleanup (setTimeout, etc.).\n   278→\n   279→- **RULE:** Use the project's established notification system for all user feedback. Do not\n   280→  add inline success/error state variables for displaying feedback messages.\n   281→  - **BECAUSE:** A centralized notification system handles auto-dismiss, positioning, and\n   282→    styling consistently.\n   283→\n   284→## 10. Build and Dev Server Management\n   285→\n   286→- **RULE:** After code changes, do not assume hot module replacement (HMR) will pick them up.\n   287→  When in doubt, restart the dev server.\n   288→  - **BECAUSE:** HMR is unreliable for many change types (new imports, structural changes,\n   289→    hook changes). A restart takes seconds and guarantees a clean state.\n   290→\n   291→- **RULE:** When the dev server shows manifest or module errors, restart the server first\n   292→  before attempting cache cleanup.\n   293→  - **BECAUSE:** A restart solves the vast majority of these issues instantly.\n   294→\n   295→- **RULE:** Always stop the dev server before running a production build. Dev caches and\n   296→  build caches can conflict.\n   297→  - **BECAUSE:** Cache conflicts produce mysterious errors that waste debugging time.\n   298→\n   299→- **RULE:** Never use `--no-lint` when building new code. It hides errors.\n   300→  - **BECAUSE:** Lint errors often indicate real problems. Suppressing them creates\n   301→    technical debt.\n   302→\n   303→## 11. Test Discipline\n   304→\n   305→- **RULE:** After ANY code change, run the related tests before moving on.\n   306→  - **BECAUSE:** Catching regressions immediately is orders of magnitude cheaper than\n   307→    finding them later.\n   308→\n   309→- **RULE:** Failing tests are YOUR responsibility. Fix them immediately --- do not defer or\n   310→  assume they were \"already broken.\"\n   311→  - **BECAUSE:** In an AI-orchestrated workflow, you are the sole developer.

These rules apply to any project\nusing the plan orchestrator. Adapt the examples to your language and framework.\n\nEach rule explains **why** it exists (the BECAUSE chain), so the AI can make correct\njudgment calls when the letter of the rule doesn't quite fit the situation.\n\n---\n\n## 0. File Headers and Design Traceability\n\n- **RULE:** Every source file MUST include a header comment with:\n  - File path (relative to project root)\n  - One-line summary of the file's purpose\n  - Reference to the design document that defines its behavior (if one exists)\n  - **BECAUSE:** Headers create an explicit link between implementation and specification,\n    preventing architectural drift.\n  - **BECAUSE:** When an AI agent picks up a task in a fresh session, the header tells it\n    where to find the design context without searching.\n\n- **RULE:** Before modifying existing code, ALWAYS verify changes against the design document\n  referenced in the header. If there is a discrepancy, raise the issue rather than silently\n  diverging.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Ensures implementation continues to align with the agreed-upon specification.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Catches unintended deviations early, before they cascade.\n\n- **RULE:** Major design changes or significant refactorings MUST be discussed and approved\n  before implementation.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Prevents costly rework if changes are later deemed undesirable.\n  - **BECAUSE:** In an orchestrated plan, one agent's unauthorized design change can break\n    assumptions held by subsequent tasks.\n\n- **RULE:** Design documents are the single source of truth for module behavior. When changing\n  code, the corresponding design doc MUST be updated to reflect the changes. Conversely, when\n  code seems incorrect, consult the design doc to understand the intended behavior.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Synchronized design and code reduces confusion and prevents drift.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Design documents provide essential context for recovering intended behavior.\n\n- **RULE:** After implementing changes and ensuring tests pass, ALWAYS perform a code review\n  (manual or automated) against the project's standards.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Code reviews catch issues that tests cannot: readability, maintainability,\n    adherence to conventions, and subtle logic errors.\n\n## 1. Naming Conventions\n\n- **RULE:** Follow your language's community conventions consistently:\n  - **PascalCase** for classes, interfaces, type definitions, React components\n  - **camelCase** for variables, functions, methods, utility files\n  - **ALL_CAPS_SNAKE_CASE** for manifest constants (values that never change at runtime)\n  - **kebab-case** for configuration files and non-code assets\n  - **BECAUSE:** Predictable naming reduces cognitive load. You can tell a file's purpose\n    from its casing alone.\n\n- **RULE:** File names containing a single primary class or component MUST be named to match\n  that class (e.g., `StatusManager.ts` for class `StatusManager`).\n  - **BECAUSE:** Creates a predictable mapping between the artifact and the filesystem,\n    reducing time spent searching for definitions.\n\n- **RULE:** Variable, function, and method names MUST be clear, descriptive, and reflect their\n  purpose. Avoid cryptic abbreviations or overly generic names (e.g., `data`, `manager`, `temp`).\n  - **BECAUSE:** The name itself should convey intent and nature, reducing the need for\n    comments and preventing ambiguity.\n\n- **RULE:** Function/method names SHOULD indicate their purpose through word choice:\n  - **Nouns/noun phrases** for functions that retrieve without side effects:\n    `orderCount`, `getUserProfile`, `isActive`\n  - **Verbs/verb phrases** for functions that alter state or perform actions:\n    `updateStatus`, `calculateTotal`, `saveConfiguration`\n  - **BECAUSE:** Signals to the reader whether calling the function might change system state.\n    This is the Command-Query Separation principle.\n\n- **RULE:** Avoid variable names that are easily confused (e.g., `orderCount` vs `orderCounts`\n  for different concepts). Be precise.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Subtle naming differences for distinct concepts lead to hard-to-find bugs.\n\n- **RULE:** Naming conventions MUST be applied consistently across the entire codebase.\n  - **BECAUSE:** A uniform style makes the codebase feel cohesive and easier to navigate.\n\n## 2. File Organization and Imports\n\n- **RULE:** Organize files into standard top-level directories based on their category:\n  - `src/` - All primary source code\n  - `scripts/` - Utility scripts for build, deployment, development tasks\n  - `docs/` - Documentation, design documents, plans\n  - `test/` or `tests/` - Test code, mocks, fixtures\n  - **BECAUSE:** Establishes a conventional structure that makes it easy to locate artifacts\n    and clearly separates source from supporting files.\n\n- **RULE:** Separate shared contracts from implementation:\n  - Shared interfaces/types/constants should live in dedicated directories\n    (e.g., `src/interfaces/`, `src/types/`, `src/constants/`)\n  - Items used only within a single module may remain co-located in that module\n  - **BECAUSE:** Centralizing shared contracts improves discoverability and prevents\n    scattering definitions across modules.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Clearly separates public API contracts from internal implementation details.\n\n- **RULE:** Any single source file exceeding 200 lines SHOULD be refactored into a module\n  folder with an entry point (`index.ts`, `__init__.py`, etc.) that exports only the\n  public API.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Prevents excessively long files that are hard to read, understand, and maintain.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Enforces a clear public API for each component.\n\n- **RULE:** Module entry points (e.g., `index.ts`) MUST only contain import/export statements.\n  No implementation logic.\n  - **BECAUSE:** The entry point defines the public contract. Mixing in logic blurs the boundary.\n\n- **RULE:** Each exported class SHOULD reside in its own distinct file.\n  - **BECAUSE:** One file, one purpose. Makes code review and maintenance simpler.\n\n- **RULE:** Test files MUST mirror the source directory structure.\n  - **EXAMPLE:** Tests for `src/services/workflow/Executor.ts` go in\n    `test/services/workflow/Executor.test.ts`.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Clear, predictable relationship between code and its tests.\n\n- **RULE:** Before creating a new file for a type, interface, or class, check whether a\n  suitable definition already exists. If it does, import it. If it does not, create it in\n  the correct location and register it in whatever central registry the project uses.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Prevents duplication and ensures a single source of truth for definitions.\n\n- **RULE:** Organize imports logically: external libraries first, then project-level aliases,\n  then relative imports. Remove all unused imports.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Consistent organization improves readability and makes dependencies clearer.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Unused imports clutter code and can cause confusion during refactoring.\n\n- **RULE:** Actively avoid and resolve circular dependencies between modules.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Circular dependencies cause runtime errors, make code harder to test,\n    and hinder modularity. Separating contracts into shared directories can break cycles.\n\n## 3. Code Structure and Readability\n\n- **RULE:** Methods SHOULD NOT exceed 30-40 lines. Extract complex logic into helper methods.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Shorter methods are easier to understand, test, and maintain. They tend to\n    have a single responsibility.\n\n- **RULE:** Classes SHOULD NOT exceed 300 lines. If a class grows beyond this, refactor into\n  a module folder.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Large classes often violate the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and\n    are hard to manage.\n\n- **RULE:** Functions accepting more than two parameters MUST use a parameter object.\n  Name the type descriptively (e.g., `CreateUserParams`, `SearchOptions`).\n  - **BECAUSE:** Parameter objects improve readability and maintainability, especially when\n    adding or removing parameters.\n\n- **RULE:** Prioritize code clarity and correctness over premature abstraction. Apply\n  abstractions when patterns are clear, not speculatively.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Maintainability and understandability come first. Three similar lines are\n    better than a premature abstraction that nobody understands.\n\n- **RULE:** Focus on minimal, necessary changes to achieve the goal. Avoid over-engineering.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Simpler solutions are easier to understand, test, and maintain.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Minimizing scope reduces the risk of unintended side effects.\n  - **BECAUSE:** In orchestrated plans, each task should do one thing well. Gold-plating\n    delays the plan and introduces risk.\n\n## 4. Types and Type Safety\n\n- **RULE:** Never use `any` as a type. Always create proper types for groups of fields.\n  TypeScript is all about types; using `any` defeats the purpose.\n  - **BECAUSE:** `any` bypasses all type checking, hiding bugs that the compiler would\n    otherwise catch.\n\n- **RULE:** Use the correct construct for the purpose:\n  - `interface` for contracts that classes can implement or objects must adhere to\n  - `type` for data shapes, function signatures, unions, intersections\n  - `class` when behavior (methods), internal state, or inheritance is required\n  - **BECAUSE:** Choosing the right construct signals intent and makes the code self-documenting.\n\n- **RULE:** Avoid \"Primitive Obsession.\" Use specific types instead of raw primitives\n  (`string`, `number`, `boolean`) to represent domain concepts.\n  - **EXAMPLE:** Use `type UserId = string` or `type Currency = 'USD' | 'EUR' | 'GBP'`\n    instead of bare strings.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Domain-specific types improve type safety, self-documentation, and\n    centralize validation logic.\n\n- **RULE:** Groups of primitives that are always used together SHOULD be encapsulated in\n  an interface or type.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Improves cohesion and makes the relationship explicit.\n\n- **RULE:** Use type assertions (`as any`, `as unknown as Type`) sparingly, with\n  justification. Fix underlying type mismatches instead.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Type assertions bypass safety and can hide bugs.\n\n- **RULE:** Never pepper code with literal constants. Use manifest constants defined at the\n  top of the file (or in a constants module) for any numeric or string value that has meaning.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Magic numbers and strings are cryptic, error-prone, and hard to update.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Constants with descriptive names make code self-documenting.\n\n## 5. Coupling and Cohesion\n\n- **RULE:** Classes MUST have a single, well-defined responsibility (Single Responsibility\n  Principle / SRP). Each class should have one reason to change.\n  - **BECAUSE:** High cohesion makes classes easier to understand, test, and maintain.\n\n- **RULE:** Methods MUST perform a single logical operation.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Single-purpose methods are more readable and testable.\n\n- **RULE:** Minimize coupling between modules. Depend on interfaces rather than concrete\n  implementations, especially across module boundaries.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Loose coupling makes the system more flexible and resilient to change.\n\n- **RULE:** Do not access private members of other classes. Interact through the public API.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Violating encapsulation creates tight coupling that breaks when internals change.\n\n- **RULE:** Avoid \"Feature Envy.\" If a method mostly operates on another class's data,\n  move it to that class.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Improves cohesion and reduces coupling.\n\n- **RULE:** Utility functions used by only one class SHOULD be private to that class or\n  its module, not exported globally.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Keeps related logic together and avoids polluting the module scope.\n\n## 6. Error Handling\n\n- **RULE:** Avoid empty `catch` blocks. Always log the error or re-throw appropriately.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Empty catches silently swallow errors, hiding problems that compound over time.\n\n- **RULE:** Do not use exceptions for normal control flow. Use conditional logic instead.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Misusing exceptions is inefficient and obscures the actual logic.\n\n- **RULE:** Provide clear, informative error messages that include context (what was being\n  attempted, what values were involved).\n  - **BECAUSE:** Good error messages cut debugging time from hours to minutes.\n\n- **RULE:** When logging, always include variable names alongside values:\n  `log(\"Failed to process order: orderId=${orderId}, status=${status}\")`\n  - **BECAUSE:** Knowing which variable holds which value makes trace logs dramatically\n    easier to read.\n\n- **RULE:** When troubleshooting unexpected values, consider whether the variable name is\n  misleading. Rename for clarity if so.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Clear naming aids debugging by making intent explicit.\n\n## 7. Comments and Documentation\n\n- **RULE:** Every exported function, interface, type, class, and global variable MUST have\n  a doc comment (JSDoc, docstring, etc.) explaining its purpose.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Documentation alongside the code improves understanding and maintainability.\n\n- **RULE:** Write comments to explain _why_, not _what_. The code should explain the what.\n  Focus on rationale, business rules, workarounds, and non-obvious decisions.\n  - **BECAUSE:** The \"why\" is context that code alone cannot convey.\n\n- **RULE:** Remove commented-out code. That's what version control is for.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Commented code is noise that becomes outdated and confusing.\n\n- **RULE:** Ensure comments are accurate and up-to-date. Fix or remove misleading ones.\n  - **BECAUSE:** An incorrect comment is worse than no comment.\n\n- **RULE:** Avoid excessive comments. If you feel the need to comment heavily, refactor\n  the code for clarity instead (better naming, smaller functions, clearer structure).\n  - **BECAUSE:** Self-documenting code is preferred. Comments that restate the obvious add\n    clutter.\n\n- **RULE:** Remove development-phase comments (TODO, FIXME, attribution) before task\n  completion. Use task trackers and commit messages instead.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Stale TODOs accumulate as noise. The orchestrator's YAML plan is the\n    proper place to track remaining work.\n\n## 8. Conditional Logic\n\n- **RULE:** Avoid large `switch` statements or long `if/else if/else` chains.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Hard to read, maintain, and extend. Often violates the Open-Closed Principle.\n\n- **RULE:** Consider polymorphism (via interfaces) or lookup maps/objects instead of\n  complex conditionals.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Leads to cleaner, more extensible, and testable designs.\n\n## 9. UI Feedback Patterns\n\n- **RULE:** Before implementing success/error notifications in a component, check for\n  existing toast, notification, or alert components in the project's UI library.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Reusing the existing notification system ensures visual consistency and UX\n    quality.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Inline state-based message divs (`{error && <div>...</div>}`) create\n    visual inconsistency, shift content, and require manual cleanup (setTimeout, etc.).\n\n- **RULE:** Use the project's established notification system for all user feedback. Do not\n  add inline success/error state variables for displaying feedback messages.\n  - **BECAUSE:** A centralized notification system handles auto-dismiss, positioning, and\n    styling consistently.\n\n## 10. Build and Dev Server Management\n\n- **RULE:** After code changes, do not assume hot module replacement (HMR) will pick them up.\n  When in doubt, restart the dev server.\n  - **BECAUSE:** HMR is unreliable for many change types (new imports, structural changes,\n    hook changes). A restart takes seconds and guarantees a clean state.\n\n- **RULE:** When the dev server shows manifest or module errors, restart the server first\n  before attempting cache cleanup.\n  - **BECAUSE:** A restart solves the vast majority of these issues instantly.\n\n- **RULE:** Always stop the dev server before running a production build. Dev caches and\n  build caches can conflict.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Cache conflicts produce mysterious errors that waste debugging time.\n\n- **RULE:** Never use `--no-lint` when building new code. It hides errors.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Lint errors often indicate real problems. Suppressing them creates\n    technical debt.\n\n## 11. Test Discipline\n\n- **RULE:** After ANY code change, run the related tests before moving on.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Catching regressions immediately is orders of magnitude cheaper than\n    finding them later.\n\n- **RULE:** Failing tests are YOUR responsibility. Fix them immediately --- do not defer or\n  assume they were \"already broken.\"\n  - **BECAUSE:** In an AI-orchestrated workflow, you are the sole developer. All failures\n    result from your changes. Leaving them creates compounding tech debt.\n\n- **RULE:** TypeScript errors in test files count as broken tests.\n  - **BECAUSE:** If it doesn't compile, it doesn't test.\n\n- **RULE:** When splitting large test suites, migrate incrementally: move one test group\n  at a time, verify it passes, then continue.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Incremental migration minimizes risk and ensures continuous validity.\n\n## 12. AI-Specific Discipline\n\nThese rules address failure modes specific to AI code generation.\n\n- **RULE:** Never remove existing functionality when asked to \"clean up\" or \"simplify.\"\n  Ask before removing any feature, field, or calculation.\n  - **BECAUSE:** AIs sometimes interpret \"simplify\" as \"delete.\" Working features are never\n    clutter.\n\n- **RULE:** Do not add features, refactor code, or make \"improvements\" beyond what was asked.\n  A bug fix doesn't need surrounding code cleaned up. A simple feature doesn't need extra\n  configurability.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Over-engineering is a common AI failure mode. Each unnecessary addition\n    introduces risk and costs tokens.\n\n- **RULE:** When a value is NULL or missing, show that state honestly (0, empty,\n  \"Not configured\"). Do not invent fallback logic to show data from unrelated sources.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Invented fallbacks mask real problems and confuse users who expect to see\n    actual state.\n\n- **RULE:** Never use \"file is too large\" as an excuse to defer work. If a file is too large,\n  split it into smaller modules and integrate them immediately.\n  - **BECAUSE:** \"Deferred\" is not a valid status. Work is either done or needs to be done now.\n\n- **RULE:** Commit frequently. Uncommitted work is lost when the session ends.\n  - **BECAUSE:** In an orchestrated workflow, each task runs in a fresh session. If the task\n    doesn't commit, the work vanishes.\n\n---\n\n## Adapting These Rules\n\nThis document is a template.

This is a condensed summary; read the full CODING-RULES.md at the project root for complete details and rationale behind each rule.\n---\n\n# Coding Rules (Summary)\n\nThis skill provides a condensed overview of the project's coding standards. Each section\nbelow summarizes a rule category. For the full rules with rationale (the BECAUSE chains)\nand examples, read **CODING-RULES.md** at the project root.\n\n## Rule 0: File Headers and Design Traceability\n\nEvery source file must include a header comment with the file path, a one-line purpose\nsummary, and a reference to the relevant design document. Before modifying code, verify\nchanges against the design document referenced in the header. Design documents are the\nsingle source of truth for module behavior; keep them synchronized with the code.\n\n## Rule 1: Naming Conventions\n\nUse PascalCase for classes, interfaces, types, and React components. Use camelCase for\nvariables, functions, methods, and utility files. Use ALL_CAPS_SNAKE_CASE for manifest\nconstants. Use kebab-case for configuration files. File names must match their primary\nclass or component. Names must be clear, descriptive, and follow Command-Query Separation\n(nouns for queries, verbs for mutations).\n\n## Rule 2: File Organization and Imports\n\nOrganize files into standard directories (src/, scripts/, docs/, tests/). Separate shared\ncontracts (interfaces, types, constants) from implementation. Files exceeding 200 lines\nshould be refactored into a module folder with an entry point that exports only the public\nAPI. Entry points must contain only import/export statements. Organize imports as: external\nlibraries, project aliases, relative imports. Remove unused imports. Avoid circular\ndependencies.\n\n## Rule 3: Code Structure and Readability\n\nMethods should not exceed 30-40 lines; extract complex logic into helpers. Classes should\nnot exceed 300 lines. Functions with more than two parameters must use a parameter object.\nPrioritize code clarity over premature abstraction. Focus on minimal, necessary changes;\navoid over-engineering.\n\n## Rule 4: Type Safety\n\nNever use the any type; create proper typed interfaces. Use interface for contracts, type\nfor data shapes and unions, class when behavior or state is required. Avoid primitive\nobsession; use domain-specific types. Never use literal magic numbers or strings; define\nmanifest constants at the top of the file or in a constants module.\n\n## Rule 5: Coupling and Cohesion\n\nClasses must have a single responsibility (SRP). Methods must perform a single logical\noperation. Depend on interfaces rather than concrete implementations. Do not access private\nmembers of other classes. Avoid Feature Envy (move methods to where the data lives).\nUtility functions used by only one class should be private to that class.\n\n## Rule 6: Error Handling\n\nNever use empty catch blocks; always log or re-throw. Do not use exceptions for control\nflow. Provide clear error messages with context (what was attempted, which values were\ninvolved). Include variable names alongside values in log statements.\n\n## Rule 7: Comments and Documentation\n\nEvery exported symbol must have a doc comment explaining its purpose. Write comments to\nexplain why, not what. Remove commented-out code (use version control). Keep comments\naccurate and up-to-date. Avoid excessive comments; refactor for clarity instead. Remove\nTODO/FIXME comments before task completion; use the YAML plan to track remaining work.\n\n## Rule 11: Test Discipline\n\nRun related tests after any code change. Failing tests are your responsibility; fix them\nimmediately. TypeScript errors in test files count as broken tests. When splitting large\ntest suites, migrate incrementally (one group at a time, verify, continue).\n\n## Rule 12: AI-Specific Discipline\n\nNever remove existing functionality when asked to simplify. Do not add features or\nimprovements beyond what was asked. Show actual state honestly (null, empty, not configured);\nnever invent fallback data. Never defer work because a file is too large; split and\nintegrate immediately. Commit frequently; uncommitted work is lost when the session ends.\n\n---\n\nFor the full rules with rationale, examples, and additional categories (conditional logic,\nUI feedback, build management), read **CODING-RULES.md** at the project root.\n"},"caller":{"type":"direct"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":185,"cache_read_input_tokens":48515,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":185},"output_tokens":25,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"c1697c5e-3207-44db-a47a-ef6f85d3831e","uuid":"02e81bdf-0f33-4b71-8027-c66b155ac508"}
