{"type":"user","message":{"role":"user","content":[{"type":"text","text":"Base directory for this skill: /Users/martinbechard/dev/claude-plan-orchestrator/.claude/skills/coding-rules\n\n# Coding Rules (Summary)\n\nThis skill provides a condensed overview of the project's coding standards. Each section\nbelow summarizes a rule category. For the full rules with rationale (the BECAUSE chains)\nand examples, read **CODING-RULES.md** at the project root.\n\n## Rule 0: File Headers and Design Traceability\n\nEvery source file must include a header comment with the file path, a one-line purpose\nsummary, and a reference to the relevant design document. Before modifying code, verify\nchanges against the design document referenced in the header. Design documents are the\nsingle source of truth for module behavior; keep them synchronized with the code.\n\n## Rule 1: Naming Conventions\n\nUse PascalCase for classes, interfaces, types, and React components. Use camelCase for\nvariables, functions, methods, and utility files. Use ALL_CAPS_SNAKE_CASE for manifest\nconstants. Use kebab-case for configuration files. File names must match their primary\nclass or component. Names must be clear, descriptive, and follow Command-Query Separation\n(nouns for queries, verbs for mutations).\n\n## Rule 2: File Organization and Imports\n\nOrganize files into standard directories (src/, scripts/, docs/, tests/). Separate shared\ncontracts (interfaces, types, constants) from implementation. Files exceeding 200 lines\nshould be refactored into a module folder with an entry point that exports only the public\nAPI. Entry points must contain only import/export statements. Organize imports as: external\nlibraries, project aliases, relative imports. Remove unused imports. Avoid circular\ndependencies.\n\n## Rule 3: Code Structure and Readability\n\nMethods should not exceed 30-40 lines; extract complex logic into helpers. Classes should\nnot exceed 300 lines. Functions with more than two parameters must use a parameter object.\nPrioritize code clarity over premature abstraction. Focus on minimal, necessary changes;\navoid over-engineering.\n\n## Rule 4: Type Safety\n\nNever use the any type; create proper typed interfaces. Use interface for contracts, type\nfor data shapes and unions, class when behavior or state is required. Avoid primitive\nobsession; use domain-specific types. Never use literal magic numbers or strings; define\nmanifest constants at the top of the file or in a constants module.\n\n## Rule 5: Coupling and Cohesion\n\nClasses must have a single responsibility (SRP). Methods must perform a single logical\noperation. Depend on interfaces rather than concrete implementations. Do not access private\nmembers of other classes. Avoid Feature Envy (move methods to where the data lives).\nUtility functions used by only one class should be private to that class.\n\n## Rule 6: Error Handling\n\nNever use empty catch blocks; always log or re-throw. Do not use exceptions for control\nflow. Provide clear error messages with context (what was attempted, which values were\ninvolved). Include variable names alongside values in log statements.\n\n## Rule 7: Comments and Documentation\n\nEvery exported symbol must have a doc comment explaining its purpose. Write comments to\nexplain why, not what. Remove commented-out code (use version control). Keep comments\naccurate and up-to-date. Avoid excessive comments; refactor for clarity instead. Remove\nTODO/FIXME comments before task completion; use the YAML plan to track remaining work.\n\n## Rule 11: Test Discipline\n\nRun related tests after any code change. Failing tests are your responsibility; fix them\nimmediately. TypeScript errors in test files count as broken tests. When splitting large\ntest suites, migrate incrementally (one group at a time, verify, continue).\n\n## Rule 12: AI-Specific Discipline\n\nNever remove existing functionality when asked to simplify. Do not add features or\nimprovements beyond what was asked. Show actual state honestly (null, empty, not configured);\nnever invent fallback data.

This is how the orchestrator knows the task result.\n\"\"\"\n\n\ndef run_smoke_tests() -> bool:\n    \"\"\"Run smoke tests to verify critical paths still work after plan completion.\n\n    Returns True if smoke tests pass, False otherwise.\n    Uses PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL to target an existing dev server (avoids starting a\n    competing QA server that would corrupt the shared .next cache).\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"\\n=== Running post-plan smoke tests ===\")\n    print(\"Verifying critical user paths...\")\n\n    # Detect which port has a running server\n    smoke_port = None\n    try:\n        check = subprocess.run(\n            [\"lsof\", \"-ti\", f\":{DEV_SERVER_PORT}\"],\n            capture_output=True, text=True, timeout=5\n        )\n        if check.stdout.strip():\n            smoke_port = DEV_SERVER_PORT\n    except Exception:\n        pass\n\n    if not smoke_port:\n        print(f\"[SMOKE] No dev server detected on port {DEV_SERVER_PORT} - skipping smoke tests\")\n        print(f\"[SMOKE] Start a server with '{DEV_SERVER_COMMAND}' before running smoke tests\")\n        return True  # Don't fail the plan if no server is running\n\n    print(f\"[SMOKE] Using existing server on port {smoke_port}\")\n\n    # Set env to target existing server and skip webServer startup\n    env = os.environ.copy()\n    env[\"PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL\"] = f\"http://localhost:{smoke_port}\"\n    env[\"SMOKE_SKIP_WEBSERVER\"] = \"true\"\n\n    try:\n        result = subprocess.run(\n            [\"npx\", \"playwright\", \"test\", \"tests/SMOKE01-critical-paths.spec.ts\",\n             \"--reporter=list\", \"--timeout=30000\",\n             \"--project=chromium\"],\n            capture_output=True,\n            text=True,\n            timeout=180,\n            cwd=os.getcwd(),\n            env=env\n        )\n\n        if result.returncode == 0:\n            print(\"[SMOKE] All smoke tests PASSED\")\n            return True\n        else:\n            print(f\"[SMOKE] Smoke tests FAILED (exit code {result.returncode})\")\n            # Show relevant output\n            for line in result.stdout.splitlines()[-20:]:\n                print(f\"  {line}\")\n            if result.stderr:\n                for line in result.stderr.splitlines()[-10:]:\n                    print(f\"  [stderr] {line}\")\n            return False\n    except subprocess.TimeoutExpired:\n        print(\"[SMOKE] Smoke tests TIMED OUT (180s)\")\n        return False\n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        print(\"[SMOKE] npx/playwright not found - skipping smoke tests\")\n        return True  # Don't fail the plan if playwright isn't installed\n\n\nclass OutputCollector:\n    \"\"\"Collects output from Claude CLI and tracks stats.\"\"\"\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.lines: list[str] = []\n        self.bytes_received = 0\n        self.line_count = 0\n\n    def add_line(self, line: str) -> None:\n        self.lines.append(line)\n        self.bytes_received += len(line.encode('utf-8'))\n        self.line_count += 1\n\n    def get_output(self) -> str:\n        return ''.join(self.lines)\n\n\ndef stream_output(pipe, prefix: str, collector: OutputCollector, show_full: bool) -> None:\n    \"\"\"Stream output from a subprocess pipe line by line.\"\"\"\n    try:\n        for line in iter(pipe.readline, ''):\n            if line:\n                collector.add_line(line)\n                if show_full:\n                    print(f\"[CLAUDE {prefix}] {line.rstrip()}\", flush=True)\n    except Exception as e:\n        if VERBOSE:\n            verbose_log(f\"Error streaming {prefix}: {e}\", \"ERROR\")\n\n\ndef stream_json_output(pipe, collector: OutputCollector, result_capture: dict) -> None:\n    \"\"\"Stream output from Claude CLI in stream-json format, showing tool use and text in real-time.\n\n    Args:\n        pipe: The stdout pipe from the Claude CLI subprocess.\n        collector: OutputCollector that accumulates raw output lines.\n        result_capture: A mutable dict that will be populated with the full result event data\n            when the 'result' event is received.
