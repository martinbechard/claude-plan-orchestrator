File Headers and Design Traceability\n    12→\n    13→- **RULE:** Every source file MUST include a header comment with:\n    14→  - File path (relative to project root)\n    15→  - One-line summary of the file's purpose\n    16→  - Reference to the design document that defines its behavior (if one exists)\n    17→  - **BECAUSE:** Headers create an explicit link between implementation and specification,\n    18→    preventing architectural drift.\n    19→  - **BECAUSE:** When an AI agent picks up a task in a fresh session, the header tells it\n    20→    where to find the design context without searching.\n    21→\n    22→- **RULE:** Before modifying existing code, ALWAYS verify changes against the design document\n    23→  referenced in the header. If there is a discrepancy, raise the issue rather than silently\n    24→  diverging.\n    25→  - **BECAUSE:** Ensures implementation continues to align with the agreed-upon specification.\n    26→  - **BECAUSE:** Catches unintended deviations early, before they cascade.\n    27→\n    28→- **RULE:** Major design changes or significant refactorings MUST be discussed and approved\n    29→  before implementation.\n    30→  - **BECAUSE:** Prevents costly rework if changes are later deemed undesirable.\n    31→  - **BECAUSE:** In an orchestrated plan, one agent's unauthorized design change can break\n    32→    assumptions held by subsequent tasks.\n    33→\n    34→- **RULE:** Design documents are the single source of truth for module behavior. When changing\n    35→  code, the corresponding design doc MUST be updated to reflect the changes. Conversely, when\n    36→  code seems incorrect, consult the design doc to understand the intended behavior.\n    37→  - **BECAUSE:** Synchronized design and code reduces confusion and prevents drift.\n    38→  - **BECAUSE:** Design documents provide essential context for recovering intended behavior.\n    39→\n    40→- **RULE:** After implementing changes and ensuring tests pass, ALWAYS perform a code review\n    41→  (manual or automated) against the project's standards.\n    42→  - **BECAUSE:** Code reviews catch issues that tests cannot: readability, maintainability,\n    43→    adherence to conventions, and subtle logic errors.\n    44→\n    45→## 1. Naming Conventions\n    46→\n    47→- **RULE:** Follow your language's community conventions consistently:\n    48→  - **PascalCase** for classes, interfaces, type definitions, React components\n    49→  - **camelCase** for variables, functions, methods, utility files\n    50→  - **ALL_CAPS_SNAKE_CASE** for manifest constants (values that never change at runtime)\n    51→  - **kebab-case** for configuration files and non-code assets\n    52→  - **BECAUSE:** Predictable naming reduces cognitive load. You can tell a file's purpose\n    53→    from its casing alone.\n    54→\n    55→- **RULE:** File names containing a single primary class or component MUST be named to match\n    56→  that class (e.g., `StatusManager.ts` for class `StatusManager`).\n    57→  - **BECAUSE:** Creates a predictable mapping between the artifact and the filesystem,\n    58→    reducing time spent searching for definitions.\n    59→\n    60→- **RULE:** Variable, function, and method names MUST be clear, descriptive, and reflect their\n    61→  purpose. Avoid cryptic abbreviations or overly generic names (e.g., `data`, `manager`, `temp`).\n    62→  - **BECAUSE:** The name itself should convey intent and nature, reducing the need for\n    63→    comments and preventing ambiguity.\n    64→\n    65→- **RULE:** Function/method names SHOULD indicate their purpose through word choice:\n    66→  - **Nouns/noun phrases** for functions that retrieve without side effects:\n    67→    `orderCount`, `getUserProfile`, `isActive`\n    68→  - **Verbs/verb phrases** for functions that alter state or perform actions:\n    69→    `updateStatus`, `calculateTotal`, `saveConfiguration`\n    70→  - **BECAUSE:** Signals to the reader whether calling the function might change system state.\n    71→    This is the Command-Query Separation principle.\n    72→\n    73→- **RULE:** Avoid variable names that are easily confused (e.g., `orderCount` vs `orderCounts`\n    74→  for different concepts). Be precise.\n    75→  - **BECAUSE:** Subtle naming differences for distinct concepts lead to hard-to-find bugs.\n    76→\n    77→- **RULE:** Naming conventions MUST be applied consistently across the entire codebase.\n    78→  - **BECAUSE:** A uniform style makes the codebase feel cohesive and easier to navigate.\n    79→\n    80→## 2. File Organization and Imports\n    81→\n    82→- **RULE:** Organize files into standard top-level directories based on their category:\n    83→  - `src/` - All primary source code\n    84→  - `scripts/` - Utility scripts for build, deployment, development tasks\n    85→  - `docs/` - Documentation, design documents, plans\n    86→  - `test/` or `tests/` - Test code, mocks, fixtures\n    87→  - **BECAUSE:** Establishes a conventional structure that makes it easy to locate artifacts\n    88→    and clearly separates source from supporting files.\n    89→\n    90→- **RULE:** Separate shared contracts from implementation:\n    91→  - Shared interfaces/types/constants should live in dedicated directories\n    92→    (e.g., `src/interfaces/`, `src/types/`, `src/constants/`)\n    93→  - Items used only within a single module may remain co-located in that module\n    94→  - **BECAUSE:** Centralizing shared contracts improves discoverability and prevents\n    95→    scattering definitions across modules.\n    96→  - **BECAUSE:** Clearly separates public API contracts from internal implementation details.\n    97→\n    98→- **RULE:** Any single source file exceeding 200 lines SHOULD be refactored into a module\n    99→  folder with an entry point (`index.ts`, `__init__.py`, etc.) that exports only the\n   100→  public API.\n   101→  - **BECAUSE:** Prevents excessively long files that are hard to read, understand, and maintain.\n   102→  - **BECAUSE:** Enforces a clear public API for each component.\n   103→\n   104→- **RULE:** Module entry points (e.g., `index.ts`) MUST only contain import/export statements.\n   105→  No implementation logic.\n   106→  - **BECAUSE:** The entry point defines the public contract. Mixing in logic blurs the boundary.\n   107→\n   108→- **RULE:** Each exported class SHOULD reside in its own distinct file.\n   109→  - **BECAUSE:** One file, one purpose. Makes code review and maintenance simpler.\n   110→\n   111→- **RULE:** Test files MUST mirror the source directory structure.\n   112→  - **EXAMPLE:** Tests for `src/services/workflow/Executor.ts` go in\n   113→    `test/services/workflow/Executor.test.ts`.\n   114→  - **BECAUSE:** Clear, predictable relationship between code and its tests.\n   115→\n   116→- **RULE:** Before creating a new file for a type, interface, or class, check whether a\n   117→  suitable definition already exists. If it does, import it. If it does not, create it in\n   118→  the correct location and register it in whatever central registry the project uses.\n   119→  - **BECAUSE:** Prevents duplication and ensures a single source of truth for definitions.\n   120→\n   121→- **RULE:** Organize imports logically: external libraries first, then project-level aliases,\n   122→  then relative imports. Remove all unused imports.\n   123→  - **BECAUSE:** Consistent organization improves readability and makes dependencies clearer.\n   124→  - **BECAUSE:** Unused imports clutter code and can cause confusion during refactoring.\n   125→\n   126→- **RULE:** Actively avoid and resolve circular dependencies between modules.\n   127→  - **BECAUSE:** Circular dependencies cause runtime errors, make code harder to test,\n   128→    and hinder modularity. Separating contracts into shared directories can break cycles.\n   129→\n   130→## 3. Code Structure and Readability\n   131→\n   132→- **RULE:** Methods SHOULD NOT exceed 30-40 lines. Extract complex logic into helper methods.\n   133→  - **BECAUSE:** Shorter methods are easier to understand, test, and maintain. They tend to\n   134→    have a single responsibility.\n   135→\n   136→- **RULE:** Classes SHOULD NOT exceed 300 lines. If a class grows beyond this, refactor into\n   137→  a module folder.\n   138→  - **BECAUSE:** Large classes often violate the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and\n   139→    are hard to manage.\n   140→\n   141→- **RULE:** Functions accepting more than two parameters MUST use a parameter object.\n   142→  Name the type descriptively (e.g., `CreateUserParams`, `SearchOptions`).\n   143→  - **BECAUSE:** Parameter objects improve readability and maintainability, especially when\n   144→    adding or removing parameters.\n   145→\n   146→- **RULE:** Prioritize code clarity and correctness over premature abstraction. Apply\n   147→  abstractions when patterns are clear, not speculatively.\n   148→  - **BECAUSE:** Maintainability and understandability come first. Three similar lines are\n   149→    better than a premature abstraction that nobody understands.\n   150→\n   151→- **RULE:** Focus on minimal, necessary changes to achieve the goal. Avoid over-engineering.\n   152→  - **BECAUSE:** Simpler solutions are easier to understand, test, and maintain.\n   153→  - **BECAUSE:** Minimizing scope reduces the risk of unintended side effects.\n   154→  - **BECAUSE:** In orchestrated plans, each task should do one thing well. Gold-plating\n   155→    delays the plan and introduces risk.\n   156→\n   157→## 4. Types and Type Safety\n   158→\n   159→- **RULE:** Never use `any` as a type. Always create proper types for groups of fields.\n   160→  TypeScript is all about types; using `any` defeats the purpose.\n   161→  - **BECAUSE:** `any` bypasses all type checking, hiding bugs that the compiler would\n   162→    otherwise catch.\n   163→\n   164→- **RULE:** Use the correct construct for the purpose:\n   165→  - `interface` for contracts that classes can implement or objects must adhere to\n   166→  - `type` for data shapes, function signatures, unions, intersections\n   167→  - `class` when behavior (methods), internal state, or inheritance is required\n   168→  - **BECAUSE:** Choosing the right construct signals intent and makes the code self-documenting.\n   169→\n   170→- **RULE:** Avoid \"Primitive Obsession.\" Use specific types instead of raw primitives\n   171→  (`string`, `number`, `boolean`) to represent domain concepts.\n   172→  - **EXAMPLE:** Use `type UserId = string` or `type Currency = 'USD' | 'EUR' | 'GBP'`\n   173→    instead of bare strings.\n   174→  - **BECAUSE:** Domain-specific types improve type safety, self-documentation, and\n   175→    centralize validation logic.\n   176→\n   177→- **RULE:** Groups of primitives that are always used together SHOULD be encapsulated in\n   178→  an interface or type.\n   179→  - **BECAUSE:** Improves cohesion and makes the relationship explicit.\n   180→\n   181→- **RULE:** Use type assertions (`as any`, `as unknown as Type`) sparingly, with\n   182→  justification. Fix underlying type mismatches instead.\n   183→  - **BECAUSE:** Type assertions bypass safety and can hide bugs.\n   184→\n   185→- **RULE:** Never pepper code with literal constants. Use manifest constants defined at the\n   186→  top of the file (or in a constants module) for any numeric or string value that has meaning.\n   187→  - **BECAUSE:** Magic numbers and strings are cryptic, error-prone, and hard to update.\n   188→  - **BECAUSE:** Constants with descriptive names make code self-documenting.\n   189→\n   190→## 5. Coupling and Cohesion\n   191→\n   192→- **RULE:** Classes MUST have a single, well-defined responsibility (Single Responsibility\n   193→  Principle / SRP). Each class should have one reason to change.\n   194→  - **BECAUSE:** High cohesion makes classes easier to understand, test, and maintain.\n   195→\n   196→- **RULE:** Methods MUST perform a single logical operation.\n   197→  - **BECAUSE:** Single-purpose methods are more readable and testable.\n   198→\n   199→- **RULE:** Minimize coupling between modules. Depend on interfaces rather than concrete\n   200→  implementations, especially across module boundaries.\n   201→  - **BECAUSE:** Loose coupling makes the system more flexible and resilient to change.\n   202→\n   203→- **RULE:** Do not access private members of other classes. Interact through the public API.\n   204→  - **BECAUSE:** Violating encapsulation creates tight coupling that breaks when internals change.\n   205→\n   206→- **RULE:** Avoid \"Feature Envy.\" If a method mostly operates on another class's data,\n   207→  move it to that class.\n   208→  - **BECAUSE:** Improves cohesion and reduces coupling.\n   209→\n   210→- **RULE:** Utility functions used by only one class SHOULD be private to that class or\n   211→  its module, not exported globally.\n   212→  - **BECAUSE:** Keeps related logic together and avoids polluting the module scope.\n   213→\n   214→## 6. Error Handling\n   215→\n   216→- **RULE:** Avoid empty `catch` blocks. Always log the error or re-throw appropriately.\n   217→  - **BECAUSE:** Empty catches silently swallow errors, hiding problems that compound over time.\n   218→\n   219→- **RULE:** Do not use exceptions for normal control flow. Use conditional logic instead.\n   220→  - **BECAUSE:** Misusing exceptions is inefficient and obscures the actual logic.\n   221→\n   222→- **RULE:** Provide clear, informative error messages that include context (what was being\n   223→  attempted, what values were involved).\n   224→  - **BECAUSE:** Good error messages cut debugging time from hours to minutes.\n   225→\n   226→- **RULE:** When logging, always include variable names alongside values:\n   227→  `log(\"Failed to process order: orderId=${orderId}, status=${status}\")`\n   228→  - **BECAUSE:** Knowing which variable holds which value makes trace logs dramatically\n   229→    easier to read.\n   230→\n   231→- **RULE:** When troubleshooting unexpected values, consider whether the variable name is\n   232→  misleading. Rename for clarity if so.\n   233→  - **BECAUSE:** Clear naming aids debugging by making intent explicit.\n   234→\n   235→## 7. Comments and Documentation\n   236→\n   237→- **RULE:** Every exported function, interface, type, class, and global variable MUST have\n   238→  a doc comment (JSDoc, docstring, etc.) explaining its purpose.\n   239→  - **BECAUSE:** Documentation alongside the code improves understanding and maintainability.\n   240→\n   241→- **RULE:** Write comments to explain _why_, not _what_. The code should explain the what.\n   242→  Focus on rationale, business rules, workarounds, and non-obvious decisions.\n   243→  - **BECAUSE:** The \"why\" is context that code alone cannot convey.\n   244→\n   245→- **RULE:** Remove commented-out code. That's what version control is for.\n   246→  - **BECAUSE:** Commented code is noise that becomes outdated and confusing.\n   247→\n   248→- **RULE:** Ensure comments are accurate and up-to-date. Fix or remove misleading ones.\n   249→  - **BECAUSE:** An incorrect comment is worse than no comment.\n   250→\n   251→- **RULE:** Avoid excessive comments. If you feel the need to comment heavily, refactor\n   252→  the code for clarity instead (better naming, smaller functions, clearer structure).\n   253→  - **BECAUSE:** Self-documenting code is preferred. Comments that restate the obvious add\n   254→    clutter.\n   255→\n   256→- **RULE:** Remove development-phase comments (TODO, FIXME, attribution) before task\n   257→  completion. Use task trackers and commit messages instead.\n   258→  - **BECAUSE:** Stale TODOs accumulate as noise. The orchestrator's YAML plan is the\n   259→    proper place to track remaining work.\n   260→\n   261→## 8. Conditional Logic\n   262→\n   263→- **RULE:** Avoid large `switch` statements or long `if/else if/else` chains.\n   264→  - **BECAUSE:** Hard to read, maintain, and extend. Often violates the Open-Closed Principle.\n   265→\n   266→- **RULE:** Consider polymorphism (via interfaces) or lookup maps/objects instead of\n   267→  complex conditionals.\n   268→  - **BECAUSE:** Leads to cleaner, more extensible, and testable designs.\n   269→\n   270→## 9. UI Feedback Patterns\n   271→\n   272→- **RULE:** Before implementing success/error notifications in a component, check for\n   273→  existing toast, notification, or alert components in the project's UI library.\n   274→  - **BECAUSE:** Reusing the existing notification system ensures visual consistency and UX\n   275→    quality.\n   276→  - **BECAUSE:** Inline state-based message divs (`{error && <div>...</div>}`) create\n   277→    visual inconsistency, shift content, and require manual cleanup (setTimeout, etc.).\n   278→\n   279→- **RULE:** Use the project's established notification system for all user feedback. Do not\n   280→  add inline success/error state variables for displaying feedback messages.\n   281→  - **BECAUSE:** A centralized notification system handles auto-dismiss, positioning, and\n   282→    styling consistently.\n   283→\n   284→## 10. Build and Dev Server Management\n   285→\n   286→- **RULE:** After code changes, do not assume hot module replacement (HMR) will pick them up.\n   287→  When in doubt, restart the dev server.\n   288→  - **BECAUSE:** HMR is unreliable for many change types (new imports, structural changes,\n   289→    hook changes). A restart takes seconds and guarantees a clean state.\n   290→\n   291→- **RULE:** When the dev server shows manifest or module errors, restart the server first\n   292→  before attempting cache cleanup.\n   293→  - **BECAUSE:** A restart solves the vast majority of these issues instantly.\n   294→\n   295→- **RULE:** Always stop the dev server before running a production build. Dev caches and\n   296→  build caches can conflict.\n   297→  - **BECAUSE:** Cache conflicts produce mysterious errors that waste debugging time.\n   298→\n   299→- **RULE:** Never use `--no-lint` when building new code. It hides errors.\n   300→  - **BECAUSE:** Lint errors often indicate real problems. Suppressing them creates\n   301→    technical debt.\n   302→\n   303→## 11. Test Discipline\n   304→\n   305→- **RULE:** After ANY code change, run the related tests before moving on.\n   306→  - **BECAUSE:** Catching regressions immediately is orders of magnitude cheaper than\n   307→    finding them later.\n   308→\n   309→- **RULE:** Failing tests are YOUR responsibility. Fix them immediately --- do not defer or\n   310→  assume they were \"already broken.\"\n   311→  - **BECAUSE:** In an AI-orchestrated workflow, you are the sole developer. All failures\n   312→    result from your changes. Leaving them creates compounding tech debt.\n   313→\n   314→- **RULE:** TypeScript errors in test files count as broken tests.\n   315→  - **BECAUSE:** If it doesn't compile, it doesn't test.\n   316→\n   317→- **RULE:** When splitting large test suites, migrate incrementally: move one test group\n   318→  at a time, verify it passes, then continue.\n   319→  - **BECAUSE:** Incremental migration minimizes risk and ensures continuous validity.\n   320→\n   321→## 12. AI-Specific Discipline\n   322→\n   323→These rules address failure modes specific to AI code generation.\n   324→\n   325→- **RULE:** Never remove existing functionality when asked to \"clean up\" or \"simplify.\"\n   326→  Ask before removing any feature, field, or calculation.\n   327→  - **BECAUSE:** AIs sometimes interpret \"simplify\" as \"delete.\" Working features are never\n   328→    clutter.\n   329→\n   330→- **RULE:** Do not add features, refactor code, or make \"improvements\" beyond what was asked.\n   331→  A bug fix doesn't need surrounding code cleaned up. A simple feature doesn't need extra\n   332→  configurability.\n   333→  - **BECAUSE:** Over-engineering is a common AI failure mode. Each unnecessary addition\n   334→    introduces risk and costs tokens.\n   335→\n   336→- **RULE:** When a value is NULL or missing, show that state honestly (0, empty,\n   337→  \"Not configured\"). Do not invent fallback logic to show data from unrelated sources.\n   338→  - **BECAUSE:** Invented fallbacks mask real problems and confuse users who expect to see\n   339→    actual state.\n   340→\n   341→- **RULE:** Never use \"file is too large\" as an excuse to defer work. If a file is too large,\n   342→  split it into smaller modules and integrate them immediately.\n   343→  - **BECAUSE:** \"Deferred\" is not a valid status. Work is either done or needs to be done now.\n   344→\n   345→- **RULE:** Commit frequently. Uncommitted work is lost when the session ends.\n   346→  - **BECAUSE:** In an orchestrated workflow, each task runs in a fresh session. If the task\n   347→    doesn't commit, the work vanishes.\n   348→\n   349→---\n   350→\n   351→## Adapting These Rules\n   352→\n   353→This document is a template. To adapt it for your project:\n   354→\n   355→1. **Add project-specific paths** - Replace generic directory examples with your actual\n   356→   layout (e.g., `src/components/` for React, `app/models/` for Rails)\n   357→2. **Add framework rules** - Add sections for your framework (e.g., React hooks rules,\n   358→   Django model conventions, API design standards)\n   359→3. **Add a definitions registry** - Consider maintaining a `definitions.md` that maps each\n   360→   class/interface/type to its canonical file path and design document\n   361→4. **Add your build commands** - Replace generic \"run the build\" with your actual commands\n   362→   (e.g., `pnpm run build`, `cargo build`, `go build ./...`)\n   363→5. **Reference from SKILL.md** - The implement skill's Step 3 says \"Read the project's\n   364→   coding rules.\" Point it at this file.\n   365→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"b89f42ed-be61-4d12-af2a-171e8f856184","uuid":"053fd194-c7e8-4714-ba59-288b964f24a5","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/Users/martinbechard/dev/claude-plan-orchestrator/CODING-RULES.md","content":"# Coding Rules\n\nStandard rules and best practices for AI-generated code. These rules apply to any project\nusing the plan orchestrator. Adapt the examples to your language and framework.\n\nEach rule explains **why** it exists (the BECAUSE chain), so the AI can make correct\njudgment calls when the letter of the rule doesn't quite fit the situation.\n\n---\n\n## 0. File Headers and Design Traceability\n\n- **RULE:** Every source file MUST include a header comment with:\n  - File path (relative to project root)\n  - One-line summary of the file's purpose\n  - Reference to the design document that defines its behavior (if one exists)\n  - **BECAUSE:** Headers create an explicit link between implementation and specification,\n    preventing architectural drift.\n  - **BECAUSE:** When an AI agent picks up a task in a fresh session, the header tells it\n    where to find the design context without searching.\n\n- **RULE:** Before modifying existing code, ALWAYS verify changes against the design document\n  referenced in the header. If there is a discrepancy, raise the issue rather than silently\n  diverging.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Ensures implementation continues to align with the agreed-upon specification.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Catches unintended deviations early, before they cascade.\n\n- **RULE:** Major design changes or significant refactorings MUST be discussed and approved\n  before implementation.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Prevents costly rework if changes are later deemed undesirable.\n  - **BECAUSE:** In an orchestrated plan, one agent's unauthorized design change can break\n    assumptions held by subsequent tasks.\n\n- **RULE:** Design documents are the single source of truth for module behavior. When changing\n  code, the corresponding design doc MUST be updated to reflect the changes. Conversely, when\n  code seems incorrect, consult the design doc to understand the intended behavior.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Synchronized design and code reduces confusion and prevents drift.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Design documents provide essential context for recovering intended behavior.\n\n- **RULE:** After implementing changes and ensuring tests pass, ALWAYS perform a code review\n  (manual or automated) against the project's standards.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Code reviews catch issues that tests cannot: readability, maintainability,\n    adherence to conventions, and subtle logic errors.\n\n## 1. Naming Conventions\n\n- **RULE:** Follow your language's community conventions consistently:\n  - **PascalCase** for classes, interfaces, type definitions, React components\n  - **camelCase** for variables, functions, methods, utility files\n  - **ALL_CAPS_SNAKE_CASE** for manifest constants (values that never change at runtime)\n  - **kebab-case** for configuration files and non-code assets\n  - **BECAUSE:** Predictable naming reduces cognitive load. You can tell a file's purpose\n    from its casing alone.\n\n- **RULE:** File names containing a single primary class or component MUST be named to match\n  that class (e.g., `StatusManager.ts` for class `StatusManager`).\n  - **BECAUSE:** Creates a predictable mapping between the artifact and the filesystem,\n    reducing time spent searching for definitions.\n\n- **RULE:** Variable, function, and method names MUST be clear, descriptive, and reflect their\n  purpose. Avoid cryptic abbreviations or overly generic names (e.g., `data`, `manager`, `temp`).\n  - **BECAUSE:** The name itself should convey intent and nature, reducing the need for\n    comments and preventing ambiguity.\n\n- **RULE:** Function/method names SHOULD indicate their purpose through word choice:\n  - **Nouns/noun phrases** for functions that retrieve without side effects:\n    `orderCount`, `getUserProfile`, `isActive`\n  - **Verbs/verb phrases** for functions that alter state or perform actions:\n    `updateStatus`, `calculateTotal`, `saveConfiguration`\n  - **BECAUSE:** Signals to the reader whether calling the function might change system state.\n    This is the Command-Query Separation principle.\n\n- **RULE:** Avoid variable names that are easily confused (e.g., `orderCount` vs `orderCounts`\n  for different concepts). Be precise.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Subtle naming differences for distinct concepts lead to hard-to-find bugs.\n\n- **RULE:** Naming conventions MUST be applied consistently across the entire codebase.\n  - **BECAUSE:** A uniform style makes the codebase feel cohesive and easier to navigate.\n\n## 2. File Organization and Imports\n\n- **RULE:** Organize files into standard top-level directories based on their category:\n  - `src/` - All primary source code\n  - `scripts/` - Utility scripts for build, deployment, development tasks\n  - `docs/` - Documentation, design documents, plans\n  - `test/` or `tests/` - Test code, mocks, fixtures\n  - **BECAUSE:** Establishes a conventional structure that makes it easy to locate artifacts\n    and clearly separates source from supporting files.\n\n- **RULE:** Separate shared contracts from implementation:\n  - Shared interfaces/types/constants should live in dedicated directories\n    (e.g., `src/interfaces/`, `src/types/`, `src/constants/`)\n  - Items used only within a single module may remain co-located in that module\n  - **BECAUSE:** Centralizing shared contracts improves discoverability and prevents\n    scattering definitions across modules.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Clearly separates public API contracts from internal implementation details.\n\n- **RULE:** Any single source file exceeding 200 lines SHOULD be refactored into a module\n  folder with an entry point (`index.ts`, `__init__.py`, etc.) that exports only the\n  public API.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Prevents excessively long files that are hard to read, understand, and maintain.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Enforces a clear public API for each component.\n\n- **RULE:** Module entry points (e.g., `index.ts`) MUST only contain import/export statements.\n  No implementation logic.\n  - **BECAUSE:** The entry point defines the public contract. Mixing in logic blurs the boundary.\n\n- **RULE:** Each exported class SHOULD reside in its own distinct file.\n  - **BECAUSE:** One file, one purpose. Makes code review and maintenance simpler.\n\n- **RULE:** Test files MUST mirror the source directory structure.\n  - **EXAMPLE:** Tests for `src/services/workflow/Executor.ts` go in\n    `test/services/workflow/Executor.test.ts`.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Clear, predictable relationship between code and its tests.\n\n- **RULE:** Before creating a new file for a type, interface, or class, check whether a\n  suitable definition already exists. If it does, import it. If it does not, create it in\n  the correct location and register it in whatever central registry the project uses.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Prevents duplication and ensures a single source of truth for definitions.\n\n- **RULE:** Organize imports logically: external libraries first, then project-level aliases,\n  then relative imports. Remove all unused imports.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Consistent organization improves readability and makes dependencies clearer.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Unused imports clutter code and can cause confusion during refactoring.\n\n- **RULE:** Actively avoid and resolve circular dependencies between modules.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Circular dependencies cause runtime errors, make code harder to test,\n    and hinder modularity. Separating contracts into shared directories can break cycles.\n\n## 3. Code Structure and Readability\n\n- **RULE:** Methods SHOULD NOT exceed 30-40 lines. Extract complex logic into helper methods.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Shorter methods are easier to understand, test, and maintain. They tend to\n    have a single responsibility.\n\n- **RULE:** Classes SHOULD NOT exceed 300 lines. If a class grows beyond this, refactor into\n  a module folder.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Large classes often violate the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and\n    are hard to manage.\n\n- **RULE:** Functions accepting more than two parameters MUST use a parameter object.\n  Name the type descriptively (e.g., `CreateUserParams`, `SearchOptions`).\n  - **BECAUSE:** Parameter objects improve readability and maintainability, especially when\n    adding or removing parameters.\n\n- **RULE:** Prioritize code clarity and correctness over premature abstraction. Apply\n  abstractions when patterns are clear, not speculatively.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Maintainability and understandability come first. Three similar lines are\n    better than a premature abstraction that nobody understands.\n\n- **RULE:** Focus on minimal, necessary changes to achieve the goal. Avoid over-engineering.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Simpler solutions are easier to understand, test, and maintain.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Minimizing scope reduces the risk of unintended side effects.\n  - **BECAUSE:** In orchestrated plans, each task should do one thing well. Gold-plating\n    delays the plan and introduces risk.\n\n## 4. Types and Type Safety\n\n- **RULE:** Never use `any` as a type. Always create proper types for groups of fields.\n  TypeScript is all about types; using `any` defeats the purpose.\n  - **BECAUSE:** `any` bypasses all type checking, hiding bugs that the compiler would\n    otherwise catch.\n\n- **RULE:** Use the correct construct for the purpose:\n  - `interface` for contracts that classes can implement or objects must adhere to\n  - `type` for data shapes, function signatures, unions, intersections\n  - `class` when behavior (methods), internal state, or inheritance is required\n  - **BECAUSE:** Choosing the right construct signals intent and makes the code self-documenting.\n\n- **RULE:** Avoid \"Primitive Obsession.\" Use specific types instead of raw primitives\n  (`string`, `number`, `boolean`) to represent domain concepts.\n  - **EXAMPLE:** Use `type UserId = string` or `type Currency = 'USD' | 'EUR' | 'GBP'`\n    instead of bare strings.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Domain-specific types improve type safety, self-documentation, and\n    centralize validation logic.\n\n- **RULE:** Groups of primitives that are always used together SHOULD be encapsulated in\n  an interface or type.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Improves cohesion and makes the relationship explicit.\n\n- **RULE:** Use type assertions (`as any`, `as unknown as Type`) sparingly, with\n  justification. Fix underlying type mismatches instead.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Type assertions bypass safety and can hide bugs.\n\n- **RULE:** Never pepper code with literal constants. Use manifest constants defined at the\n  top of the file (or in a constants module) for any numeric or string value that has meaning.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Magic numbers and strings are cryptic, error-prone, and hard to update.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Constants with descriptive names make code self-documenting.\n\n## 5. Coupling and Cohesion\n\n- **RULE:** Classes MUST have a single, well-defined responsibility (Single Responsibility\n  Principle / SRP). Each class should have one reason to change.\n  - **BECAUSE:** High cohesion makes classes easier to understand, test, and maintain.\n\n- **RULE:** Methods MUST perform a single logical operation.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Single-purpose methods are more readable and testable.\n\n- **RULE:** Minimize coupling between modules. Depend on interfaces rather than concrete\n  implementations, especially across module boundaries.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Loose coupling makes the system more flexible and resilient to change.\n\n- **RULE:** Do not access private members of other classes. Interact through the public API.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Violating encapsulation creates tight coupling that breaks when internals change.\n\n- **RULE:** Avoid \"Feature Envy.\" If a method mostly operates on another class's data,\n  move it to that class.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Improves cohesion and reduces coupling.\n\n- **RULE:** Utility functions used by only one class SHOULD be private to that class or\n  its module, not exported globally.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Keeps related logic together and avoids polluting the module scope.\n\n## 6. Error Handling\n\n- **RULE:** Avoid empty `catch` blocks. Always log the error or re-throw appropriately.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Empty catches silently swallow errors, hiding problems that compound over time.\n\n- **RULE:** Do not use exceptions for normal control flow. Use conditional logic instead.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Misusing exceptions is inefficient and obscures the actual logic.\n\n- **RULE:** Provide clear, informative error messages that include context (what was being\n  attempted, what values were involved).\n  - **BECAUSE:** Good error messages cut debugging time from hours to minutes.\n\n- **RULE:** When logging, always include variable names alongside values:\n  `log(\"Failed to process order: orderId=${orderId}, status=${status}\")`\n  - **BECAUSE:** Knowing which variable holds which value makes trace logs dramatically\n    easier to read.\n\n- **RULE:** When troubleshooting unexpected values, consider whether the variable name is\n  misleading. Rename for clarity if so.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Clear naming aids debugging by making intent explicit.\n\n## 7. Comments and Documentation\n\n- **RULE:** Every exported function, interface, type, class, and global variable MUST have\n  a doc comment (JSDoc, docstring, etc.) explaining its purpose.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Documentation alongside the code improves understanding and maintainability.\n\n- **RULE:** Write comments to explain _why_, not _what_. The code should explain the what.\n  Focus on rationale, business rules, workarounds, and non-obvious decisions.\n  - **BECAUSE:** The \"why\" is context that code alone cannot convey.\n\n- **RULE:** Remove commented-out code. That's what version control is for.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Commented code is noise that becomes outdated and confusing.\n\n- **RULE:** Ensure comments are accurate and up-to-date. Fix or remove misleading ones.\n  - **BECAUSE:** An incorrect comment is worse than no comment.\n\n- **RULE:** Avoid excessive comments. If you feel the need to comment heavily, refactor\n  the code for clarity instead (better naming, smaller functions, clearer structure).\n  - **BECAUSE:** Self-documenting code is preferred. Comments that restate the obvious add\n    clutter.\n\n- **RULE:** Remove development-phase comments (TODO, FIXME, attribution) before task\n  completion. Use task trackers and commit messages instead.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Stale TODOs accumulate as noise. The orchestrator's YAML plan is the\n    proper place to track remaining work.\n\n## 8. Conditional Logic\n\n- **RULE:** Avoid large `switch` statements or long `if/else if/else` chains.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Hard to read, maintain, and extend. Often violates the Open-Closed Principle.\n\n- **RULE:** Consider polymorphism (via interfaces) or lookup maps/objects instead of\n  complex conditionals.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Leads to cleaner, more extensible, and testable designs.\n\n## 9. UI Feedback Patterns\n\n- **RULE:** Before implementing success/error notifications in a component, check for\n  existing toast, notification, or alert components in the project's UI library.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Reusing the existing notification system ensures visual consistency and UX\n    quality.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Inline state-based message divs (`{error && <div>...</div>}`) create\n    visual inconsistency, shift content, and require manual cleanup (setTimeout, etc.).\n\n- **RULE:** Use the project's established notification system for all user feedback. Do not\n  add inline success/error state variables for displaying feedback messages.\n  - **BECAUSE:** A centralized notification system handles auto-dismiss, positioning, and\n    styling consistently.\n\n## 10. Build and Dev Server Management\n\n- **RULE:** After code changes, do not assume hot module replacement (HMR) will pick them up.\n  When in doubt, restart the dev server.\n  - **BECAUSE:** HMR is unreliable for many change types (new imports, structural changes,\n    hook changes). A restart takes seconds and guarantees a clean state.\n\n- **RULE:** When the dev server shows manifest or module errors, restart the server first\n  before attempting cache cleanup.\n  - **BECAUSE:** A restart solves the vast majority of these issues instantly.\n\n- **RULE:** Always stop the dev server before running a production build. Dev caches and\n  build caches can conflict.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Cache conflicts produce mysterious errors that waste debugging time.\n\n- **RULE:** Never use `--no-lint` when building new code. It hides errors.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Lint errors often indicate real problems. Suppressing them creates\n    technical debt.\n\n## 11. Test Discipline\n\n- **RULE:** After ANY code change, run the related tests before moving on.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Catching regressions immediately is orders of magnitude cheaper than\n    finding them later.\n\n- **RULE:** Failing tests are YOUR responsibility. Fix them immediately --- do not defer or\n  assume they were \"already broken.\"\n  - **BECAUSE:** In an AI-orchestrated workflow, you are the sole developer. All failures\n    result from your changes. Leaving them creates compounding tech debt.\n\n- **RULE:** TypeScript errors in test files count as broken tests.\n  - **BECAUSE:** If it doesn't compile, it doesn't test.\n\n- **RULE:** When splitting large test suites, migrate incrementally: move one test group\n  at a time, verify it passes, then continue.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Incremental migration minimizes risk and ensures continuous validity.\n\n## 12. AI-Specific Discipline\n\nThese rules address failure modes specific to AI code generation.\n\n- **RULE:** Never remove existing functionality when asked to \"clean up\" or \"simplify.\"\n  Ask before removing any feature, field, or calculation.\n  - **BECAUSE:** AIs sometimes interpret \"simplify\" as \"delete.\" Working features are never\n    clutter.\n\n- **RULE:** Do not add features, refactor code, or make \"improvements\" beyond what was asked.\n  A bug fix doesn't need surrounding code cleaned up. A simple feature doesn't need extra\n  configurability.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Over-engineering is a common AI failure mode. Each unnecessary addition\n    introduces risk and costs tokens.\n\n- **RULE:** When a value is NULL or missing, show that state honestly (0, empty,\n  \"Not configured\"). Do not invent fallback logic to show data from unrelated sources.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Invented fallbacks mask real problems and confuse users who expect to see\n    actual state.\n\n- **RULE:** Never use \"file is too large\" as an excuse to defer work. If a file is too large,\n  split it into smaller modules and integrate them immediately.\n  - **BECAUSE:** \"Deferred\" is not a valid status. Work is either done or needs to be done now.\n\n- **RULE:** Commit frequently. Uncommitted work is lost when the session ends.\n  - **BECAUSE:** In an orchestrated workflow, each task runs in a fresh session. If the task\n    doesn't commit, the work vanishes.\n\n---\n\n## Adapting These Rules\n\nThis document is a template. To adapt it for your project:\n\n1. **Add project-specific paths** - Replace generic directory examples with your actual\n   layout (e.g., `src/components/` for React, `app/models/` for Rails)\n2. **Add framework rules** - Add sections for your framework (e.g., React hooks rules,\n   Django model conventions, API design standards)\n3. **Add a definitions registry** - Consider maintaining a `definitions.md` that maps each\n   class/interface/type to its canonical file path and design document\n4. **Add your build commands** - Replace generic \"run the build\" with your actual commands\n   (e.g., `pnpm run build`, `cargo build`, `go build ./...`)\n5. **Reference from SKILL.md** - The implement skill's Step 3 says \"Read the project's\n   coding rules.\" Point it at this file.\n","numLines":365,"startLine":1,"totalLines":365}}}

They use Read/Grep/Glob only. The planner needs Write and Bash to modify the YAML plan and write status.\n   131→\n   132→2. **Inference defaults systems-designer for \"design\" keyword.** When a task description mentions \"design\" without specifying UX, the inference routes to systems-designer because architecture design is more common in the competition context. UX tasks should use the explicit agent: ux-designer field.\n   133→\n   134→3. **Planner uses sonnet, designers use opus.** Design generation requires creative, complex reasoning (opus). Plan generation is structured output that benefits from sonnet's reliability and speed.\n   135→\n   136→4. **Agent teams are a plan pattern, not orchestrator code.** The existing parallel_group mechanism handles agent teams naturally. No new orchestrator code is needed for team dispatch.\n   137→\n   138→5. **Inference checks both task name and description.** The name field is also scanned for keywords since Phase 0 tasks often have short names like \"Generate Design 1\" where the keyword appears in the name, not the description.\n   139→\n   140→6. **Keyword priority order.** REVIEWER_KEYWORDS are checked first (existing behavior), then DESIGNER_KEYWORDS, then PLANNER_KEYWORDS, then default \"coder\".

Planner Agent (planner.md)\n\nRole: Bridges winning designs into implementation YAML plans.\n\n- **Focus:** Reading the winning design and judge feedback, creating implementation phases with proper dependencies and agent assignments\n- **Produces:** Valid YAML task sections appended to the plan file\n- **Sets:** plan_modified: true so orchestrator reloads\n- **Model:** sonnet (structured output generation)\n- **Tools:** Read, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob (needs Write to modify the YAML plan)\n\nOutput format: YAML task sections following the project plan schema, with proper section/task IDs, dependencies, descriptions, and agent assignments.\n\n### Agent Inference Updates\n\nExpand infer_agent_for_task() in plan-orchestrator.py to recognize design-related keywords:\n\nCurrent (2 outcomes):\n- REVIEWER_KEYWORDS -> \"code-reviewer\"\n- Default -> \"coder\"\n\nAfter this feature (4 outcomes):\n- REVIEWER_KEYWORDS -> \"code-reviewer\"\n- DESIGNER_KEYWORDS (design, wireframe, layout, architecture, mockup) -> \"systems-designer\"\n- PLANNER_KEYWORDS (extend plan, create tasks, create phases, plan sections) -> \"planner\"\n- Default -> \"coder\"\n\nThe task name is also scanned (not just description) to catch short-form task names like \"Generate Design 1\".\n\nDesign decision: Single-word \"design\" maps to systems-designer by default. For UX design tasks, use the explicit agent field: agent: ux-designer. This avoids ambiguity since many architecture tasks also say \"design\" but mean systems design.\n\n### Competition Template Updates\n\nThe Phase 0 template in the implement skill (SKILL.md) and the plan creation template (PLAN_CREATION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE in auto-pipeline.py) get updated to:\n\n1. List all seven agents (coder, code-reviewer, validator, issue-verifier, systems-designer, ux-designer, planner)\n2. Show how to assign agents to Phase 0 competition tasks:\n   - Design generation tasks (0.1-0.5): agent: systems-designer or agent: ux-designer\n   - Judge task (0.6): no agent (uses default coder inference)\n   - Plan extension task (0.7): agent: planner\n3. Show agent team dispatch: when a feature needs both architecture and UX, create paired tasks (one systems-designer + one ux-designer) in the same parallel_group\n\n### Agent Team Dispatch\n\nFor features requiring both architectural and UX design, the Phase 0 template supports dispatching complementary agent pairs. This is a plan structure pattern, not orchestrator code:\n\n    - id: '0.1'\n      name: Systems Design - Approach A\n      agent: systems-designer\n      parallel_group: phase-0-designs\n      description: |\n        Create architecture design for approach A.\n        OUTPUT: Write to docs/plans/feature-design-1-systems.md\n\n    - id: '0.2'\n      name: UX Design - Approach A\n      agent: ux-designer\n      parallel_group: phase-0-designs\n      description: |\n        Create UX design complementing systems design in approach A.\n        OUTPUT: Write to docs/plans/feature-design-1-ux.md\n\nThe judge task (0.6) evaluates both the systems and UX designs as complementary pairs, scoring each pair holistically.\n\n---\n\n## Key Files\n\n### New Files\n\n| File | Purpose |\n|------|---------|\n| .claude/agents/systems-designer.md | Architecture and data model design agent |\n| .claude/agents/ux-designer.md | Visual and interaction design agent |\n| .claude/agents/planner.md | Design-to-implementation YAML plan bridge agent |\n\n### Modified Files\n\n| File | Change |\n|------|--------|\n| scripts/plan-orchestrator.py | Add DESIGNER_KEYWORDS, PLANNER_KEYWORDS; expand infer_agent_for_task() to scan name+description |\n| scripts/auto-pipeline.py | Update PLAN_CREATION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE agent list to include all 7 agents |\n| .claude/skills/implement/SKILL.md | Update Phase 0 template with agent assignments and team dispatch examples |\n\n---\n\n## Design Decisions\n\n1. **Design agents are read-only (except planner).** Systems-designer and ux-designer produce design documents, not code. They use Read/Grep/Glob only. The planner needs Write and Bash to modify the YAML plan and write status.\n\n2. **Inference defaults systems-designer for \"design\" keyword.** When a task description mentions \"design\" without specifying UX, the inference routes to systems-designer because architecture design is more common in the competition context. UX tasks should use the explicit agent: ux-designer field.\n\n3. **Planner uses sonnet, designers use opus.** Design generation requires creative, complex reasoning (opus). Plan generation is structured output that benefits from sonnet's reliability and speed.\n\n4. **Agent teams are a plan pattern, not orchestrator code.** The existing parallel_group mechanism handles agent teams naturally. No new orchestrator code is needed for team dispatch.\n\n5. **Inference checks both task name and description.** The name field is also scanned for keywords since Phase 0 tasks often have short names like \"Generate Design 1\" where the keyword appears in the name, not the description.\n\n6. **Keyword priority order.** REVIEWER_KEYWORDS are checked first (existing behavior), then DESIGNER_KEYWORDS, then PLANNER_KEYWORDS, then default \"coder\". This preserves backward compatibility.\n","numLines":141,"startLine":1,"totalLines":141}}}

You produce design documents, NOT code.\nYou analyze existing code to inform your designs but never modify files.\n\n## Before Designing\n\nComplete this checklist before starting your design:\n\n1. Read the competition brief / task description thoroughly\n2. Read existing source code in the areas the feature will touch\n3. Identify existing patterns, data models, and API boundaries\n4. Read the design document referenced in the task (if any)\n\n## Design Output Structure\n\nYour design document must include these sections:\n\n- **Architecture Overview:** High-level component diagram (ASCII). Show the major\n  modules, their responsibilities, and how data flows between them.\n- **Data Models:** TypeScript interfaces for all new data shapes. Follow existing\n  naming conventions (PascalCase for types, camelCase for fields).\n- **Component Hierarchy:** Parent-child relationships and props flow. Show which\n  components own state and which receive it.\n- **API Boundaries:** Endpoints, request/response shapes, and error cases. Define\n  the contract between modules clearly.\n- **Integration Points:** How new code connects to existing modules. Identify\n  imports, shared types, and extension points.\n- **Trade-off Analysis:** Alternatives considered with pros/cons of the chosen\n  approach. Explain why the selected design wins.\n- **Scalability Considerations:** How the design handles growth in data volume,\n  user count, or feature scope without requiring redesign.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nThese are the criteria the judge uses to score your design:\n\n- **Scalability (0-10):** Handles growth without requiring redesign\n- **Maintainability (0-10):** Clear separation of concerns, testable units\n- **Integration (0-10):** Fits existing codebase patterns and conventions\n- **Completeness (0-10):** All requirements from the competition brief addressed\n- **Feasibility (0-10):** Implementable within project constraints and timeline\n\n## Constraints\n\n- You are READ-ONLY with respect to project source files. Never use Write, Edit,\n  or Bash tools to modify existing code or configuration.\n- Only use Read, Grep, and Glob to inspect the codebase.\n- Your sole writable output is the design document at the OUTPUT path specified\n  in the task description.\n- Use ASCII diagrams for all visual representations, not images.\n- Base every design decision on evidence from the existing codebase.\n\n## Output Protocol\n\nWhen your design is complete, write a status file to .claude/plans/task-status.json:\n\n    {\n      \"task_id\": \"<the task id>\",\n      \"status\": \"completed\",\n      \"message\": \"Brief description of the design produced\",\n      \"timestamp\": \"<ISO 8601 timestamp>\",\n      \"plan_modified\": false\n    }\n\nIf the design cannot be completed (e.g., competition brief missing or unclear),\nset status to \"failed\" with a clear message explaining what went wrong.\n","numLines":83,"startLine":1,"totalLines":83}}}

Let me compile my findings.\n\n`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`\n**Inference keyword priority is critical here.** The design doc specifies that PLANNER_KEYWORDS must be checked before DESIGNER_KEYWORDS because planner phrases like \"create phases\" wouldn't conflict, but the word \"design\" in DESIGNER_KEYWORDS would match planner descriptions that mention \"winning design.\" The REVIEWER_KEYWORDS check first because \"review\" could appear in design-related contexts too. This cascading priority order prevents false routing.\n`─────────────────────────────────────────────────`\n\nLet me now verify the frontmatter fields match the design spec for each agent.\n\n**Review against design document requirements:**\n\n**Agent files verification:**\n\n| Agent | Name | Model | Tools | Design Spec |\n|-------|------|-------|-------|-------------|\n| systems-designer | systems-designer | opus | Read, Grep, Glob | **MATCH** - Design says opus, read-only tools |\n| ux-designer | ux-designer | opus | Read, Grep, Glob | **MATCH** - Design says opus, read-only tools |\n| planner | planner | sonnet | Read, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob | **MATCH** - Design says sonnet, needs Write for plan |\n\n**Inference logic verification:**\n\n| Test Case | Expected | Actual | Result |\n|-----------|----------|--------|--------|\n| \"Verify build passes\" | code-reviewer | \"verify\" matches REVIEWER_KEYWORDS | PASS |\n| \"Implement the feature\" | coder | No keywords match, default | PASS |\n| \"Generate Design 1\" (name) | systems-designer | \"design\" matches DESIGNER_KEYWORDS | PASS |\n| \"Create architecture design\" | systems-designer | \"architecture\" matches DESIGNER_KEYWORDS | PASS |\n| \"Extend plan with implementation\" | planner | \"extend plan\" matches PLANNER_KEYWORDS | PASS |\n| \"Create phases for implementation\" | planner | \"create phases\" matches PLANNER_KEYWORDS | PASS |\n| \"Review the design\" | code-reviewer | \"review\" matches REVIEWER_KEYWORDS first (priority) | PASS |\n\n**Template verification:**\n- auto-pipeline.py Agent Selection (line 784): Lists all 5 user-facing agents (coder, code-reviewer, systems-designer, ux-designer, planner) plus Phase 0 example. **MATCH** with design doc.\n- SKILL.md Phase 0 template (line 178): Shows agent: systems-designer on task 0.1, agent: planner on task 0.7, and Agent Team Dispatch subsection. **MATCH** with design doc.\n\nNow let me write the formal review report and status file.\n\n---\n\n**VERDICT: PASS**\n\n**FINDINGS:**\n\n- [PASS] **Agent files exist with valid frontmatter.** All three new files (.claude/agents/systems-designer.md:1-11, .claude/agents/ux-designer.md:1-11, .claude/agents/planner.md:1-13) exist with proper YAML frontmatter containing name, description, tools, and model fields.\n\n- [PASS] **Frontmatter values match design spec.** systems-designer uses opus/Read,Grep,Glob; ux-designer uses opus/Read,Grep,Glob; planner uses sonnet/Read,Write,Bash,Grep,Glob — all matching docs/plans/2026-02-14-04-design-agents-design.md specifications.\n\n- [PASS] **Frontmatter format consistent with existing agents.** New agent files follow the same markdown-with-YAML-frontmatter format as coder.md and code-reviewer.md (--- delimited, same field order).\n\n- [PASS] **DESIGNER_KEYWORDS and PLANNER_KEYWORDS constants defined.** scripts/plan-orchestrator.py:146-155 defines both keyword lists with correct values matching the design doc.\n\n- [PASS] **Constants follow ALL_CAPS_SNAKE_CASE naming.** DESIGNER_KEYWORDS and PLANNER_KEYWORDS at plan-orchestrator.py:146,152 follow the same naming convention as existing REVIEWER_KEYWORDS.\n\n- [PASS] **Inference function handles 4 outcomes.** infer_agent_for_task() at plan-orchestrator.py:169-199 checks REVIEWER_KEYWORDS first, then PLANNER_KEYWORDS, then DESIGNER_KEYWORDS, then defaults to \"coder\" — matching the design doc priority order.\n\n- [PASS] **Inference scans both name and description.** plan-orchestrator.py:185 combines `task.get(\"name\", \"\")` and `task.get(\"description\", \"\")` before scanning, matching design requirement for name+description scanning.\n\n- [PASS] **PLANNER_KEYWORDS checked before DESIGNER_KEYWORDS.** plan-orchestrator.py:191-193 checks planner phrases before designer single-words, preventing false matches where \"design\" in a planner task description would route to systems-designer instead.\n\n- [PASS] **PLAN_CREATION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE updated.** auto-pipeline.py:784-831 lists all 5 agents with Phase 0 competition example and updated inference description.\n\n- [PASS] **Implement skill Phase 0 template updated.** SKILL.md:178-242 shows agent: systems-designer on design tasks, agent: planner on plan extension task, and Agent Team Dispatch subsection with paired agent example.\n\n- [PASS] **Docstring updated.** infer_agent_for_task() docstring at plan-orchestrator.py:170-181 accurately documents the 4-outcome logic with priority explanation.\n\n**EVIDENCE:**\n\n- Finding 1 (Agent files): All three files parsed successfully with `---` delimiters. systems-designer.md has name=\"systems-designer\", model=\"opus\"; ux-designer.md has name=\"ux-designer\", model=\"opus\"; planner.md has name=\"planner\", model=\"sonnet\".\n- Finding 2 (Inference priority): Code at plan-orchestrator.py:187-199 shows three sequential `for keyword in ...` loops followed by `return \"coder\"`, matching the design's priority chain: reviewer > planner > designer > coder.\n- Finding 3 (Name scanning): Line 185 `text = (task.get(\"name\", \"\") + \" \" + task.get(\"description\", \"\")).lower()` confirms both name and description are combined and lowercased before keyword matching.\n- Finding 4 (Template agents): auto-pipeline.py:789-800 lists coder, code-reviewer, systems-designer, ux-designer, and planner with descriptions matching the design doc.\n- Finding 5 (Skill template): SKILL.md:189 shows `agent: systems-designer` and SKILL.md:210 shows `agent: planner` with the new Agent Team Dispatch subsection at line 220.\n\n---\n\nNow let me write the status file."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1013,"cache_read_input_tokens":60510,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":1013},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"b89f42ed-be61-4d12-af2a-171e8f856184","uuid":"aebf3c0a-62a0-4d8f-9074-82fde726d49c"}
