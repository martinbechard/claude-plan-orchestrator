The user experience changes slightly: instead of raw text stdout, we get JSON. But since non-verbose mode already shows progress dots (not raw output), the display is unaffected. We parse the JSON after process completion.\n   176→\n   177→2. **Use total_cost_usd from CLI, never calculate cost from tokens.** The CLI cost calculation accounts for pricing tiers, model variants, and cache discounts. Recalculating would be fragile and duplicate logic.\n   178→\n   179→3. **PlanUsageTracker lives in plan-orchestrator.py, not a separate module.** The orchestrator is a single-file script by convention. Adding a class to it follows the existing pattern of TaskResult, CircuitBreaker, OutputCollector.\n   180→\n   181→4. **Usage report goes to .claude/plans/logs/ alongside task logs.** This is the natural home for execution artifacts. The report filename includes the plan name for easy identification.\n   182→\n   183→5. **stream_json_output() captures usage data via a shared mutable dict.** Rather than changing the function signature (which would break threading), we pass a dict that it populates with the result event data. This is thread-safe because only the stdout thread writes to it (single writer, reader waits for thread join).\n   184→\n   185→6. **Auto-pipeline reads the usage report file rather than parsing orchestrator stdout.** This is cleaner and avoids fragile stdout parsing. The orchestrator writes the report, the pipeline reads it.\n   186→\n   187→7. **Cache hit rate uses cache_read / (cache_read + input_tokens).** This measures what fraction of input context was served from cache vs. freshly processed. A higher rate means lower cost per token.\n   188→\n   189→8. **parse_task_usage() is a pure function.** Extracting a standalone helper makes it testable without mocking CLI processes. Both verbose and non-verbose paths call the same function.\n   190→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"5438b3cd-004c-4461-8e41-ed885ff146f7","uuid":"47938998-b2c3-4c31-802e-30231093d538","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/Users/martinbechard/dev/claude-plan-orchestrator/docs/plans/2026-02-14-06-token-usage-tracking-design.md","content":"# Token Usage Tracking and Cost Reporting - Design Document\n\n**Goal:** Track token consumption across orchestrator tasks and auto-pipeline work items, producing per-task and aggregate usage reports.\n\n**Architecture:** Add a TaskUsage dataclass to hold per-task metrics (tokens, cost, cache stats).

The usage report file is written by the orchestrator itself, so the auto-pipeline does not need to parse orchestrator stdout for usage data. Instead:\n\n1. After execute_plan() returns, read the usage report JSON if it exists\n2. Accumulate per-work-item totals (plan creation + orchestrator execution)\n3. At session end, write a session-level summary to .claude/plans/logs/pipeline-session-{timestamp}.json\n\n---\n\n## Key Files\n\n### Modified Files\n\n| File | Change |\n|------|--------|\n| scripts/plan-orchestrator.py | TaskUsage dataclass, parse CLI JSON output, PlanUsageTracker, usage report, log enhancement |\n| scripts/auto-pipeline.py | Read usage reports, aggregate per-session |\n\n### New Files\n\n| File | Purpose |\n|------|--------|\n| tests/test_token_usage.py | Unit tests for TaskUsage, PlanUsageTracker, usage parsing |\n| .claude/plans/logs/*-usage-report.json | Generated usage reports (not committed) |\n\n---\n\n## Design Decisions\n\n1. **Always use --output-format json in non-verbose mode.** This is the minimal change to get structured output. The user experience changes slightly: instead of raw text stdout, we get JSON. But since non-verbose mode already shows progress dots (not raw output), the display is unaffected. We parse the JSON after process completion.\n\n2. **Use total_cost_usd from CLI, never calculate cost from tokens.** The CLI cost calculation accounts for pricing tiers, model variants, and cache discounts. Recalculating would be fragile and duplicate logic.\n\n3. **PlanUsageTracker lives in plan-orchestrator.py, not a separate module.** The orchestrator is a single-file script by convention. Adding a class to it follows the existing pattern of TaskResult, CircuitBreaker, OutputCollector.\n\n4. **Usage report goes to .claude/plans/logs/ alongside task logs.** This is the natural home for execution artifacts. The report filename includes the plan name for easy identification.\n\n5. **stream_json_output() captures usage data via a shared mutable dict.** Rather than changing the function signature (which would break threading), we pass a dict that it populates with the result event data. This is thread-safe because only the stdout thread writes to it (single writer, reader waits for thread join).\n\n6. **Auto-pipeline reads the usage report file rather than parsing orchestrator stdout.** This is cleaner and avoids fragile stdout parsing. The orchestrator writes the report, the pipeline reads it.\n\n7. **Cache hit rate uses cache_read / (cache_read + input_tokens).** This measures what fraction of input context was served from cache vs. freshly processed. A higher rate means lower cost per token.\n\n8. **parse_task_usage() is a pure function.** Extracting a standalone helper makes it testable without mocking CLI processes. Both verbose and non-verbose paths call the same function.\n","numLines":190,"startLine":1,"totalLines":190}}}
