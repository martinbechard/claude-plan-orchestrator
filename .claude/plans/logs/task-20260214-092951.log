{"type":"user","message":{"role":"user","content":[{"type":"text","text":"Base directory for this skill: /Users/martinbechard/dev/claude-plan-orchestrator/.claude/skills/coding-rules\n\n# Coding Rules (Summary)\n\nThis skill provides a condensed overview of the project's coding standards. Each section\nbelow summarizes a rule category. For the full rules with rationale (the BECAUSE chains)\nand examples, read **CODING-RULES.md** at the project root.\n\n## Rule 0: File Headers and Design Traceability\n\nEvery source file must include a header comment with the file path, a one-line purpose\nsummary, and a reference to the relevant design document. Before modifying code, verify\nchanges against the design document referenced in the header. Design documents are the\nsingle source of truth for module behavior; keep them synchronized with the code.\n\n## Rule 1: Naming Conventions\n\nUse PascalCase for classes, interfaces, types, and React components. Use camelCase for\nvariables, functions, methods, and utility files. Use ALL_CAPS_SNAKE_CASE for manifest\nconstants. Use kebab-case for configuration files. File names must match their primary\nclass or component. Names must be clear, descriptive, and follow Command-Query Separation\n(nouns for queries, verbs for mutations).\n\n## Rule 2: File Organization and Imports\n\nOrganize files into standard directories (src/, scripts/, docs/, tests/). Separate shared\ncontracts (interfaces, types, constants) from implementation. Files exceeding 200 lines\nshould be refactored into a module folder with an entry point that exports only the public\nAPI. Entry points must contain only import/export statements. Organize imports as: external\nlibraries, project aliases, relative imports. Remove unused imports. Avoid circular\ndependencies.\n\n## Rule 3: Code Structure and Readability\n\nMethods should not exceed 30-40 lines; extract complex logic into helpers. Classes should\nnot exceed 300 lines. Functions with more than two parameters must use a parameter object.\nPrioritize code clarity over premature abstraction. Focus on minimal, necessary changes;\navoid over-engineering.\n\n## Rule 4: Type Safety\n\nNever use the any type; create proper typed interfaces. Use interface for contracts, type\nfor data shapes and unions, class when behavior or state is required. Avoid primitive\nobsession; use domain-specific types. Never use literal magic numbers or strings; define\nmanifest constants at the top of the file or in a constants module.\n\n## Rule 5: Coupling and Cohesion\n\nClasses must have a single responsibility (SRP). Methods must perform a single logical\noperation. Depend on interfaces rather than concrete implementations. Do not access private\nmembers of other classes. Avoid Feature Envy (move methods to where the data lives).\nUtility functions used by only one class should be private to that class.\n\n## Rule 6: Error Handling\n\nNever use empty catch blocks; always log or re-throw. Do not use exceptions for control\nflow. Provide clear error messages with context (what was attempted, which values were\ninvolved). Include variable names alongside values in log statements.\n\n## Rule 7: Comments and Documentation\n\nEvery exported symbol must have a doc comment explaining its purpose. Write comments to\nexplain why, not what. Remove commented-out code (use version control). Keep comments\naccurate and up-to-date. Avoid excessive comments; refactor for clarity instead. Remove\nTODO/FIXME comments before task completion; use the YAML plan to track remaining work.\n\n## Rule 11: Test Discipline\n\nRun related tests after any code change. Failing tests are your responsibility; fix them\nimmediately. TypeScript errors in test files count as broken tests. When splitting large\ntest suites, migrate incrementally (one group at a time, verify, continue).\n\n## Rule 12: AI-Specific Discipline\n\nNever remove existing functionality when asked to simplify. Do not add features or\nimprovements beyond what was asked. Show actual state honestly (null, empty, not configured);\nnever invent fallback data. Never defer work because a file is too large; split and\nintegrate immediately. Commit frequently; uncommitted work is lost when the session ends.\n\n---\n\nFor the full rules with rationale, examples, and additional categories (conditional logic,\nUI feedback, build management), read **CODING-RULES.md** at the project root.\n"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"19812e97-aee8-41e6-8aea-52c1f481f5b6","uuid":"828145ce-4cc7-406c-8dac-e190d051e83e","isSynthetic":true}

We parse the JSON after process completion.\n\n2. **Use total_cost_usd from CLI, never calculate cost from tokens.** The CLI cost calculation accounts for pricing tiers, model variants, and cache discounts. Recalculating would be fragile and duplicate logic.\n\n3. **PlanUsageTracker lives in plan-orchestrator.py, not a separate module.** The orchestrator is a single-file script by convention. Adding a class to it follows the existing pattern of TaskResult, CircuitBreaker, OutputCollector.\n\n4. **Usage report goes to .claude/plans/logs/ alongside task logs.** This is the natural home for execution artifacts. The report filename includes the plan name for easy identification.\n\n5. **stream_json_output() captures usage data via a shared mutable dict.** Rather than changing the function signature (which would break threading), we pass a dict that it populates with the result event data. This is thread-safe because only the stdout thread writes to it (single writer, reader waits for thread join).\n\n6. **Auto-pipeline reads the usage report file rather than parsing orchestrator stdout.** This is cleaner and avoids fragile stdout parsing. The orchestrator writes the report, the pipeline reads it.\n\n7. **Cache hit rate uses cache_read / (cache_read + input_tokens).** This measures what fraction of input context was served from cache vs. freshly processed. A higher rate means lower cost per token.\n\n8. **parse_task_usage() is a pure function.** Extracting a standalone helper makes it testable without mocking CLI processes. Both verbose and non-verbose paths call the same function.\n","numLines":190,"startLine":1,"totalLines":190}}}
