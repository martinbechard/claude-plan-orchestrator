The validator runs the code-reviewer agent on the task's output, then aggregates findings into a PASS/WARN/FAIL verdict. On FAIL, the task is retried with findings prepended to the prompt. On WARN, the task is marked completed with warnings logged. On PASS, the task proceeds normally. Validation is opt-in via plan meta configuration.\n\n**Tech Stack:** Python 3 (plan-orchestrator.py), YAML (plan meta.validation configuration), Markdown (agent definitions in .claude/agents/)\n\n---\n\n## Architecture Overview\n\n### Dependency: Feature 02 (Agent Definition Framework)\n\nThis feature depends on the agent definition framework introduced by Feature 02. Specifically:\n- Agent markdown files in .claude/agents/ with YAML frontmatter\n- load_agent_definition() function in plan-orchestrator.py\n- build_claude_prompt() with agent content injection\n\n### Validation Flow\n\nThe validation pipeline inserts into the existing task execution flow:\n\n    1. Task executes (coder agent) -> TaskResult.success = True\n    2. Check if validation is enabled for this task type\n    3. If enabled: spawn validator agent with task context\n    4. Parse validator output for PASS/WARN/FAIL verdict\n    5. On PASS: mark task completed (normal flow)\n    6. On WARN: mark task completed, log warnings\n    7. On FAIL: mark task pending, prepend findings to next attempt\n\n### ValidationConfig Dataclass\n\nNew dataclass to hold per-plan validation settings:\n\n    @dataclass\n    class ValidationConfig:\n        \"\"\"Configuration for per-task validation.\"\"\"\n        enabled: bool = False\n        run_after: list[str]           # Agent types that trigger validation\n        validators: list[str]          # Validator agent names to run\n        max_validation_attempts: int = 1  # How many validation retries per task\n\nDefault run_after: [\"coder\"]\nDefault validators: [\"validator\"]\n\nParsed from plan meta.validation:\n\n    meta:\n      validation:\n        enabled: true\n        run_after:\n          - coder\n        validators:\n          - validator\n\n### Validation Verdict\n\n    @dataclass\n    class ValidationVerdict:\n        \"\"\"Result of a validation pass.\"\"\"\n        verdict: str     # \"PASS\", \"WARN\", or \"FAIL\"\n        findings: list[str]\n        raw_output: str\n\nThe verdict is extracted from the validator's stdout using a regex pattern matching:\n\n    **Verdict: PASS**  or  **Verdict: WARN**  or  **Verdict: FAIL**\n\n    **Findings:**\n    - [PASS|WARN|FAIL] Description with file:line references\n\n### Validator Agent Definition\n\nNew agent file: .claude/agents/validator.md\n\nThe validator agent:\n1.

Your job is to independently review code changes\nfor compliance with CODING-RULES.md. You are READ-ONLY and must NOT modify any code\nfiles. You analyze, report findings, and produce a structured verdict.\n\n## Before Reviewing\n\nComplete this checklist before starting your review:\n\n1. Read CODING-RULES.md in the project root\n2. Read the design document referenced in the task description\n3. Identify the files that were changed or created by the preceding task\n4. Understand the expected behavior from the YAML plan\n\n## Review Checklist\n\nEvaluate each item and record a finding for every issue discovered.\n\n- **File Headers:** Every source file must include a header comment with the file\n  path, a one-line purpose summary, and a reference to the design document.\n- **Naming Conventions:** PascalCase for classes/interfaces/types, camelCase for\n  functions/variables, ALL_CAPS_SNAKE_CASE for constants, kebab-case for config files.\n- **Type Safety:** No any types anywhere. Proper typed interfaces for all data shapes.\n  Use interface for contracts, type for data shapes and unions.\n- **File Organization:** Files should be under 200 lines. Imports organized with\n  external libraries first, then project aliases, then relative imports. No unused\n  imports.\n- **Coupling:** Single responsibility per module. Depend on interfaces, not\n  implementations. No circular dependencies.\n- **Error Handling:** No empty catch blocks. Error messages must be informative and\n  include context about what failed and why.\n- **Constants:** No literal magic numbers or strings in logic. All values defined as\n  manifest constants (ALL_CAPS_SNAKE_CASE) at the top of the file.\n- **AI Anti-Patterns:** No over-engineering beyond what was requested. No removed\n  functionality without explicit permission. No fake fallback data. No hardcoded\n  lists duplicating a registry. No TODO/FIXME comments.\n\n## Output Format\n\nProduce a structured findings report using this exact format:\n\n    VERDICT: PASS | WARN | FAIL\n\n    FINDINGS:\n    - [PASS] Description with file:line references\n    - [WARN] Description with file:line references\n    - [FAIL] Description with file:line references\n\n    EVIDENCE:\n    - Finding 1: Specific code snippet or reference supporting the finding\n    - Finding 2: Specific code snippet or reference supporting the finding\n\nVerdict rules:\n- **PASS:** All checklist items satisfied. Minor style suggestions allowed as [PASS].\n- **WARN:** Non-critical issues found. Code works but does not fully comply with\n  coding standards. No blocking problems.\n- **FAIL:** Critical issues found. Type safety violations, empty catch blocks,\n  missing file headers, or removed functionality.\n\n## Constraints\n\n- You are READ-ONLY. Never use Edit, Write, or Bash tools.\n- Only use Read, Grep, and Glob to inspect the codebase.\n- Do not suggest fixes inline. Report findings and let the coder agent fix them.\n- Be specific: always include file:line references in findings.\n- Be objective: base every finding on a concrete rule from CODING-RULES.md.\n\n## Output Protocol\n\nWhen your review is complete, write a status file to .claude/plans/task-status.json:\n\n    {\n      \"task_id\": \"<the task id>\",\n      \"status\": \"completed\",\n      \"message\": \"Brief summary: VERDICT and number of findings\",\n      \"timestamp\": \"<ISO 8601 timestamp>\",\n      \"plan_modified\": false\n    }\n\nIf the review cannot be completed (e.g., files missing), set status to \"failed\" with\na clear message explaining what went wrong.\n","numLines":97,"startLine":1,"totalLines":97}}}

This is enforced by instruction rather than tooling — the agent framework trusts the agent definition to self-enforce constraints. This is a pragmatic design: the alternative (a custom sandboxed Bash) would add significant complexity for marginal safety gain in a single-developer workflow.\n`─────────────────────────────────────────────────`\n\nTask 1.1 is complete. The validator agent definition has been created at `.claude/agents/validator.md` with:\n\n- **Frontmatter:** `name: validator`, description, tools `[Read, Grep, Glob, Bash]`, model `sonnet`\n- **Role section:** Read-only post-task verifier that reports but does not fix\n- **Before Validating checklist:** 4-item pre-validation checklist\n- **Validation Steps:** Build, test, requirement verification, regression check\n- **Output Format:** Structured `**Verdict: PASS/WARN/FAIL**` with findings and evidence\n- **Verdict Rules:** Clear criteria for each verdict level\n- **Constraints:** Bash limited to verification commands only, no file modifications\n- **Output Protocol:** Status file format matching the orchestrator's expectations","stop_reason":null,"session_id":"db40e77e-4c59-4bd7-8754-adba1c85be1d","total_cost_usd":0.37745575,"usage":{"input_tokens":8,"cache_creation_input_tokens":27913,"cache_read_input_tokens":284473,"output_tokens":2187,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":27913,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0},"inference_geo":"","iterations":[],"speed":"standard"},"modelUsage":{"claude-opus-4-6":{"inputTokens":8,"outputTokens":2187,"cacheReadInputTokens":284473,"cacheCreationInputTokens":27913,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.3714077499999999,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":32000},"claude-haiku-4-5-20251001":{"inputTokens":5443,"outputTokens":121,"cacheReadInputTokens":0,"cacheCreationInputTokens":0,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.0060479999999999996,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":32000}},"permission_denials":[],"uuid":"5491bb40-421e-4d2c-b0e8-269f25cb9b99"}
