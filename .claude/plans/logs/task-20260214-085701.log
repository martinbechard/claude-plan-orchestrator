{"type":"user","message":{"role":"user","content":[{"type":"text","text":"Base directory for this skill: /Users/martinbechard/dev/claude-plan-orchestrator/.claude/skills/coding-rules\n\n# Coding Rules (Summary)\n\nThis skill provides a condensed overview of the project's coding standards. Each section\nbelow summarizes a rule category. For the full rules with rationale (the BECAUSE chains)\nand examples, read **CODING-RULES.md** at the project root.\n\n## Rule 0: File Headers and Design Traceability\n\nEvery source file must include a header comment with the file path, a one-line purpose\nsummary, and a reference to the relevant design document. Before modifying code, verify\nchanges against the design document referenced in the header. Design documents are the\nsingle source of truth for module behavior; keep them synchronized with the code.\n\n## Rule 1: Naming Conventions\n\nUse PascalCase for classes, interfaces, types, and React components. Use camelCase for\nvariables, functions, methods, and utility files. Use ALL_CAPS_SNAKE_CASE for manifest\nconstants. Use kebab-case for configuration files. File names must match their primary\nclass or component. Names must be clear, descriptive, and follow Command-Query Separation\n(nouns for queries, verbs for mutations).\n\n## Rule 2: File Organization and Imports\n\nOrganize files into standard directories (src/, scripts/, docs/, tests/). Separate shared\ncontracts (interfaces, types, constants) from implementation. Files exceeding 200 lines\nshould be refactored into a module folder with an entry point that exports only the public\nAPI. Entry points must contain only import/export statements. Organize imports as: external\nlibraries, project aliases, relative imports. Remove unused imports. Avoid circular\ndependencies.\n\n## Rule 3: Code Structure and Readability\n\nMethods should not exceed 30-40 lines; extract complex logic into helpers. Classes should\nnot exceed 300 lines. Functions with more than two parameters must use a parameter object.\nPrioritize code clarity over premature abstraction. Focus on minimal, necessary changes;\navoid over-engineering.\n\n## Rule 4: Type Safety\n\nNever use the any type; create proper typed interfaces. Use interface for contracts, type\nfor data shapes and unions, class when behavior or state is required. Avoid primitive\nobsession; use domain-specific types. Never use literal magic numbers or strings; define\nmanifest constants at the top of the file or in a constants module.\n\n## Rule 5: Coupling and Cohesion\n\nClasses must have a single responsibility (SRP). Methods must perform a single logical\noperation. Depend on interfaces rather than concrete implementations. Do not access private\nmembers of other classes. Avoid Feature Envy (move methods to where the data lives).\nUtility functions used by only one class should be private to that class.\n\n## Rule 6: Error Handling\n\nNever use empty catch blocks; always log or re-throw. Do not use exceptions for control\nflow. Provide clear error messages with context (what was attempted, which values were\ninvolved). Include variable names alongside values in log statements.\n\n## Rule 7: Comments and Documentation\n\nEvery exported symbol must have a doc comment explaining its purpose. Write comments to\nexplain why, not what. Remove commented-out code (use version control). Keep comments\naccurate and up-to-date. Avoid excessive comments; refactor for clarity instead. Remove\nTODO/FIXME comments before task completion; use the YAML plan to track remaining work.\n\n## Rule 11: Test Discipline\n\nRun related tests after any code change. Failing tests are your responsibility; fix them\nimmediately. TypeScript errors in test files count as broken tests. When splitting large\ntest suites, migrate incrementally (one group at a time, verify, continue).\n\n## Rule 12: AI-Specific Discipline\n\nNever remove existing functionality when asked to simplify. Do not add features or\nimprovements beyond what was asked. Show actual state honestly (null, empty, not configured);\nnever invent fallback data. Never defer work because a file is too large; split and\nintegrate immediately.

The existing agent framework (feature 02) handles loading and prompt injection; this feature extends it with design-specific agents and inference keywords.\n\n**Tech Stack:** Python 3 (plan-orchestrator.py, auto-pipeline.py), YAML (plan schema), Markdown with YAML frontmatter (agent definitions)\n\n**Dependency:** Feature 02 (Agent Definition Framework) - completed\n\n---\n\n## Architecture Overview\n\n### New Agent Definitions\n\nThree agents join the existing coder, code-reviewer, validator, and issue-verifier:\n\n#### 1. Systems Design Agent (systems-designer.md)\n\nRole: Architecture and data model design for Phase 0 competitions.\n\n- **Focus:** TypeScript interfaces, component hierarchy, data flow diagrams, API boundaries, service architecture\n- **Evaluates:** Scalability, maintainability, integration with existing code\n- **Model:** opus (complex architectural reasoning)\n- **Tools:** Read, Grep, Glob (read-only; produces design documents, not code)\n\nOutput format: A design document with sections for architecture, data models, component hierarchy, integration points, and trade-off analysis.\n\n#### 2. UX Designer Agent (ux-designer.md)\n\nRole: Visual and interaction design for Phase 0 competitions.\n\n- **Focus:** ASCII wireframes, component specs, state diagrams, user workflows\n- **Evaluates:** Clarity, mobile UX, accessibility, consistency with existing design system\n- **Model:** opus (creative design tasks)\n- **Tools:** Read, Grep, Glob (read-only; produces design specs, not code)\n\nOutput format: A design document with ASCII wireframes for all states (normal, loading, error, empty), interaction specs, and mobile/accessibility considerations.\n\n#### 3. Planner Agent (planner.md)\n\nRole: Bridges winning designs into implementation YAML plans.\n\n- **Focus:** Reading the winning design and judge feedback, creating implementation phases with proper dependencies and agent assignments\n- **Produces:** Valid YAML task sections appended to the plan file\n- **Sets:** plan_modified: true so orchestrator reloads\n- **Model:** sonnet (structured output generation)\n- **Tools:** Read, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob (needs Write to modify the YAML plan)\n\nOutput format: YAML task sections following the project plan schema, with proper section/task IDs, dependencies, descriptions, and agent assignments.\n\n### Agent Inference Updates\n\nExpand infer_agent_for_task() in plan-orchestrator.py to recognize design-related keywords:\n\nCurrent (2 outcomes):\n- REVIEWER_KEYWORDS -> \"code-reviewer\"\n- Default -> \"coder\"\n\nAfter this feature (4 outcomes):\n- REVIEWER_KEYWORDS -> \"code-reviewer\"\n- DESIGNER_KEYWORDS (design, wireframe, layout, architecture, mockup) -> \"systems-designer\"\n- PLANNER_KEYWORDS (extend plan, create tasks, create phases, plan sections) -> \"planner\"\n- Default -> \"coder\"\n\nThe task name is also scanned (not just description) to catch short-form task names like \"Generate Design 1\".\n\nDesign decision: Single-word \"design\" maps to systems-designer by default. For UX design tasks, use the explicit agent field: agent: ux-designer. This avoids ambiguity since many architecture tasks also say \"design\" but mean systems design.\n\n### Competition Template Updates\n\nThe Phase 0 template in the implement skill (SKILL.md) and the plan creation template (PLAN_CREATION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE in auto-pipeline.py) get updated to:\n\n1. List all seven agents (coder, code-reviewer, validator, issue-verifier, systems-designer, ux-designer, planner)\n2. Show how to assign agents to Phase 0 competition tasks:\n   - Design generation tasks (0.1-0.5): agent: systems-designer or agent: ux-designer\n   - Judge task (0.6): no agent (uses default coder inference)\n   - Plan extension task (0.7): agent: planner\n3. Show agent team dispatch: when a feature needs both architecture and UX, create paired tasks (one systems-designer + one ux-designer) in the same parallel_group\n\n### Agent Team Dispatch\n\nFor features requiring both architectural and UX design, the Phase 0 template supports dispatching complementary agent pairs. This is a plan structure pattern, not orchestrator code:\n\n    - id: '0.1'\n      name: Systems Design - Approach A\n      agent: systems-designer\n      parallel_group: phase-0-designs\n      description: |\n        Create architecture design for approach A.\n        OUTPUT: Write to docs/plans/feature-design-1-systems.md\n\n    - id: '0.2'\n      name: UX Design - Approach A\n      agent: ux-designer\n      parallel_group: phase-0-designs\n      description: |\n        Create UX design complementing systems design in approach A.\n        OUTPUT: Write to docs/plans/feature-design-1-ux.md\n\nThe judge task (0.6) evaluates both the systems and UX designs as complementary pairs, scoring each pair holistically.\n\n---\n\n## Key Files\n\n### New Files\n\n| File | Purpose |\n|------|---------|\n| .claude/agents/systems-designer.md | Architecture and data model design agent |\n| .claude/agents/ux-designer.md | Visual and interaction design agent |\n| .claude/agents/planner.md | Design-to-implementation YAML plan bridge agent |\n\n### Modified Files\n\n| File | Change |\n|------|--------|\n| scripts/plan-orchestrator.py | Add DESIGNER_KEYWORDS, PLANNER_KEYWORDS; expand infer_agent_for_task() to scan name+description |\n| scripts/auto-pipeline.py | Update PLAN_CREATION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE agent list to include all 7 agents |\n| .claude/skills/implement/SKILL.md | Update Phase 0 template with agent assignments and team dispatch examples |\n\n---\n\n## Design Decisions\n\n1. **Design agents are read-only (except planner).** Systems-designer and ux-designer produce design documents, not code.
