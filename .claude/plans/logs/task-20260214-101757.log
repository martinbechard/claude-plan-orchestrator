{"type":"user","message":{"role":"user","content":[{"type":"text","text":"Base directory for this skill: /Users/martinbechard/dev/claude-plan-orchestrator/.claude/skills/coding-rules\n\n# Coding Rules (Summary)\n\nThis skill provides a condensed overview of the project's coding standards. Each section\nbelow summarizes a rule category. For the full rules with rationale (the BECAUSE chains)\nand examples, read **CODING-RULES.md** at the project root.\n\n## Rule 0: File Headers and Design Traceability\n\nEvery source file must include a header comment with the file path, a one-line purpose\nsummary, and a reference to the relevant design document. Before modifying code, verify\nchanges against the design document referenced in the header. Design documents are the\nsingle source of truth for module behavior; keep them synchronized with the code.\n\n## Rule 1: Naming Conventions\n\nUse PascalCase for classes, interfaces, types, and React components. Use camelCase for\nvariables, functions, methods, and utility files. Use ALL_CAPS_SNAKE_CASE for manifest\nconstants. Use kebab-case for configuration files. File names must match their primary\nclass or component. Names must be clear, descriptive, and follow Command-Query Separation\n(nouns for queries, verbs for mutations).\n\n## Rule 2: File Organization and Imports\n\nOrganize files into standard directories (src/, scripts/, docs/, tests/). Separate shared\ncontracts (interfaces, types, constants) from implementation. Files exceeding 200 lines\nshould be refactored into a module folder with an entry point that exports only the public\nAPI. Entry points must contain only import/export statements. Organize imports as: external\nlibraries, project aliases, relative imports. Remove unused imports. Avoid circular\ndependencies.\n\n## Rule 3: Code Structure and Readability\n\nMethods should not exceed 30-40 lines; extract complex logic into helpers. Classes should\nnot exceed 300 lines. Functions with more than two parameters must use a parameter object.\nPrioritize code clarity over premature abstraction. Focus on minimal, necessary changes;\navoid over-engineering.\n\n## Rule 4: Type Safety\n\nNever use the any type; create proper typed interfaces. Use interface for contracts, type\nfor data shapes and unions, class when behavior or state is required. Avoid primitive\nobsession; use domain-specific types. Never use literal magic numbers or strings; define\nmanifest constants at the top of the file or in a constants module.\n\n## Rule 5: Coupling and Cohesion\n\nClasses must have a single responsibility (SRP). Methods must perform a single logical\noperation. Depend on interfaces rather than concrete implementations. Do not access private\nmembers of other classes. Avoid Feature Envy (move methods to where the data lives).\nUtility functions used by only one class should be private to that class.\n\n## Rule 6: Error Handling\n\nNever use empty catch blocks; always log or re-throw. Do not use exceptions for control\nflow. Provide clear error messages with context (what was attempted, which values were\ninvolved). Include variable names alongside values in log statements.\n\n## Rule 7: Comments and Documentation\n\nEvery exported symbol must have a doc comment explaining its purpose. Write comments to\nexplain why, not what. Remove commented-out code (use version control). Keep comments\naccurate and up-to-date. Avoid excessive comments; refactor for clarity instead. Remove\nTODO/FIXME comments before task completion; use the YAML plan to track remaining work.\n\n## Rule 11: Test Discipline\n\nRun related tests after any code change. Failing tests are your responsibility; fix them\nimmediately. TypeScript errors in test files count as broken tests. When splitting large\ntest suites, migrate incrementally (one group at a time, verify, continue).\n\n## Rule 12: AI-Specific Discipline\n\nNever remove existing functionality when asked to simplify. Do not add features or\nimprovements beyond what was asked. Show actual state honestly (null, empty, not configured);\nnever invent fallback data.

They use Read/Grep/Glob only. The planner needs Write and Bash to modify the YAML plan and write status.\n   131→\n   132→2. **Inference defaults systems-designer for \"design\" keyword.** When a task description mentions \"design\" without specifying UX, the inference routes to systems-designer because architecture design is more common in the competition context. UX tasks should use the explicit agent: ux-designer field.\n   133→\n   134→3. **Planner uses sonnet, designers use opus.** Design generation requires creative, complex reasoning (opus). Plan generation is structured output that benefits from sonnet's reliability and speed.\n   135→\n   136→4. **Agent teams are a plan pattern, not orchestrator code.** The existing parallel_group mechanism handles agent teams naturally. No new orchestrator code is needed for team dispatch.\n   137→\n   138→5. **Inference checks both task name and description.** The name field is also scanned for keywords since Phase 0 tasks often have short names like \"Generate Design 1\" where the keyword appears in the name, not the description.\n   139→\n   140→6. **Keyword priority order.** REVIEWER_KEYWORDS are checked first (existing behavior), then DESIGNER_KEYWORDS, then PLANNER_KEYWORDS, then default \"coder\".

Show how to assign agents to Phase 0 competition tasks:\n   - Design generation tasks (0.1-0.5): agent: systems-designer or agent: ux-designer\n   - Judge task (0.6): no agent (uses default coder inference)\n   - Plan extension task (0.7): agent: planner\n3. Show agent team dispatch: when a feature needs both architecture and UX, create paired tasks (one systems-designer + one ux-designer) in the same parallel_group\n\n### Agent Team Dispatch\n\nFor features requiring both architectural and UX design, the Phase 0 template supports dispatching complementary agent pairs. This is a plan structure pattern, not orchestrator code:\n\n    - id: '0.1'\n      name: Systems Design - Approach A\n      agent: systems-designer\n      parallel_group: phase-0-designs\n      description: |\n        Create architecture design for approach A.\n        OUTPUT: Write to docs/plans/feature-design-1-systems.md\n\n    - id: '0.2'\n      name: UX Design - Approach A\n      agent: ux-designer\n      parallel_group: phase-0-designs\n      description: |\n        Create UX design complementing systems design in approach A.\n        OUTPUT: Write to docs/plans/feature-design-1-ux.md\n\nThe judge task (0.6) evaluates both the systems and UX designs as complementary pairs, scoring each pair holistically.\n\n---\n\n## Key Files\n\n### New Files\n\n| File | Purpose |\n|------|---------|\n| .claude/agents/systems-designer.md | Architecture and data model design agent |\n| .claude/agents/ux-designer.md | Visual and interaction design agent |\n| .claude/agents/planner.md | Design-to-implementation YAML plan bridge agent |\n\n### Modified Files\n\n| File | Change |\n|------|--------|\n| scripts/plan-orchestrator.py | Add DESIGNER_KEYWORDS, PLANNER_KEYWORDS; expand infer_agent_for_task() to scan name+description |\n| scripts/auto-pipeline.py | Update PLAN_CREATION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE agent list to include all 7 agents |\n| .claude/skills/implement/SKILL.md | Update Phase 0 template with agent assignments and team dispatch examples |\n\n---\n\n## Design Decisions\n\n1. **Design agents are read-only (except planner).** Systems-designer and ux-designer produce design documents, not code. They use Read/Grep/Glob only. The planner needs Write and Bash to modify the YAML plan and write status.\n\n2. **Inference defaults systems-designer for \"design\" keyword.** When a task description mentions \"design\" without specifying UX, the inference routes to systems-designer because architecture design is more common in the competition context. UX tasks should use the explicit agent: ux-designer field.\n\n3. **Planner uses sonnet, designers use opus.** Design generation requires creative, complex reasoning (opus). Plan generation is structured output that benefits from sonnet's reliability and speed.\n\n4. **Agent teams are a plan pattern, not orchestrator code.** The existing parallel_group mechanism handles agent teams naturally. No new orchestrator code is needed for team dispatch.\n\n5. **Inference checks both task name and description.** The name field is also scanned for keywords since Phase 0 tasks often have short names like \"Generate Design 1\" where the keyword appears in the name, not the description.\n\n6. **Keyword priority order.** REVIEWER_KEYWORDS are checked first (existing behavior), then DESIGNER_KEYWORDS, then PLANNER_KEYWORDS, then default \"coder\". This preserves backward compatibility.\n","numLines":141,"startLine":1,"totalLines":141}}}

Read the CLAUDE.md file for project conventions\n5. If the backlog item has a ## Verification Log section, READ IT CAREFULLY.\n   Previous fix attempts and their verification results are recorded there.\n   Your plan MUST address any unresolved findings from prior verifications.\n\n## What to produce\n\n1. Create a design document at: docs/plans/{date}-{slug}-design.md\n   - Brief architecture overview\n   - Key files to create/modify\n   - Design decisions\n\n2. Create a YAML plan at: .claude/plans/{slug}.yaml\n   - Use the exact format: meta + sections with nested tasks\n   - Each section has: id, name, status: pending, tasks: [...]\n   - Each task has: id, name, description, status: pending\n   - Task descriptions should be detailed enough for a fresh Claude session to execute\n   - Include: documentation tasks, implementation tasks, unit tests, verification\n   - The verification task should run {build_command} and {test_command}\n\n3.

Read the backlog item file: {item_path}\n2. Read procedure-coding-rules.md for coding standards\n3. Read an existing YAML plan for format reference: look at .claude/plans/*.yaml files\n4. Read the CLAUDE.md file for project conventions\n5. If the backlog item has a ## Verification Log section, READ IT CAREFULLY.\n   Previous fix attempts and their verification results are recorded there.\n   Your plan MUST address any unresolved findings from prior verifications.\n\n## What to produce\n\n1. Create a design document at: docs/plans/{date}-{slug}-design.md\n   - Brief architecture overview\n   - Key files to create/modify\n   - Design decisions\n\n2. Create a YAML plan at: .claude/plans/{slug}.yaml\n   - Use the exact format: meta + sections with nested tasks\n   - Each section has: id, name, status: pending, tasks: [...]\n   - Each task has: id, name, description, status: pending\n   - Task descriptions should be detailed enough for a fresh Claude session to execute\n   - Include: documentation tasks, implementation tasks, unit tests, verification\n   - The verification task should run {build_command} and {test_command}\n\n3. Validate the plan: python scripts/plan-orchestrator.py --plan .claude/plans/{slug}.yaml --dry-run\n   - If validation fails, fix the YAML format and retry\n\n4. Git commit both files with message: \"plan: add {slug} design and YAML plan\"\n\n## Backlog item type: {item_type}\n\n## Agent Selection\n\nTasks can specify which agent should execute them via the optional \"agent\" field.\nAvailable agents are in {agents_dir}:\n\n- **coder**: Implementation specialist. Use for coding, implementation, and\n  modification tasks. This is the default if no agent is specified.\n- **code-reviewer**: Read-only reviewer. Use for verification, review, and\n  compliance-checking tasks.\n\nExample:\n  - id: '2.1'\n    name: Implement the feature\n    agent: coder\n    status: pending\n    description: ...\n\n  - id: '3.1'\n    name: Review code quality\n    agent: code-reviewer\n    status: pending\n    description: ...\n\nIf you do not set the agent field, the orchestrator will infer it from the\ntask description (verification tasks get code-reviewer, everything else gets coder).\n\n## Validation (Optional)\n\nPlans can enable per-task validation by adding a validation block to the meta section. When enabled, a validator agent runs after each coder task to independently verify the result.\n\nExample meta configuration:\n\n  meta:\n    validation:\n      enabled: true\n      run_after:\n        - coder\n      validators:\n        - validator\n      max_validation_attempts: 1\n\nThe validator produces PASS/WARN/FAIL verdicts:\n- PASS: task proceeds normally\n- WARN: task completes but warnings are logged\n- FAIL: task is retried with validation findings prepended to the prompt\n\nFor defect fixes, use the issue-verifier validator instead of or in addition to the default validator. This validator reads the original defect file and checks whether reported symptoms are resolved.\n\n## Important\n- Follow the CLAUDE.md change workflow order: docs -> code -> tests -> verification\n- For defects: include a task to verify the fix with a regression test\n- For features: include documentation, implementation, unit tests, and E2E tests as appropriate\n- Keep tasks focused - each task should be completable in one Claude session (under 10 minutes)\n- If the backlog item has a ## Verification Log with unresolved findings, your plan\n  must specifically address those findings. The previous code fix may be correct but\n  incomplete (e.g., operational steps not executed, data not deployed).\n\"\"\"\n\n\ndef reset_interrupted_tasks(plan_path: str) -> int:\n    \"\"\"Reset in_progress tasks back to pending and clear their attempt counters.\n\n    When the pipeline is killed mid-task, the orchestrator leaves tasks as\n    'in_progress'.

Your job is to check whether a defect's\nreported symptoms have been fully resolved. You must NOT fix anything. You only observe and report.\n\n## Instructions\n\n1. Read the defect file: {item_path}\n2. Read the \"Expected Behavior\" and \"Actual Behavior\" sections carefully\n3. Read the \"Fix Required\" section for any commands or checks that should be performed\n4. If there is a \"## Verification Log\" section, read previous verification attempts\n\n## What to check\n\nFor each item in \"Fix Required\" or \"Verification\" that describes a testable condition:\n- Run the command or check the condition\n- Record whether it passed or failed\n- Record the actual output or observation\n\nAlso check:\n- Does `{build_command}` pass? (code correctness)\n- Do unit tests pass? (`{test_command}`)\n- Is the reported symptom actually gone? (the MOST IMPORTANT check)\n\n## What to produce\n\nAppend your findings to the defect file at {item_path}.\nIf no \"## Verification Log\" section exists, create one at the end of the file.\n\nUse this exact format (the count MUST increment from the last entry, or start at 1):\n\n```\n### Verification #{count} -

be specific about command outputs)\n```\n\n## CRITICAL RULES\n\n- Do NOT modify any code files\n- Do NOT fix anything\n- Do NOT change the defect's ## Status line\n- ONLY read, run verification commands, and append findings to the defect file\n- If you need the dev server running for a check, start it with `{dev_server_command}`, wait for it,\n  run your check, then stop it\n- Git commit the updated defect file with message: \"verify: {slug} verification #{count}\"\n\"\"\"\n\n# Maximum number of verify-then-fix cycles before giving up\nMAX_VERIFICATION_CYCLES = 3\n\n\ndef count_verification_attempts(item_path: str) -> int:\n    \"\"\"Count how many verification entries exist in the defect file.\"\"\"\n    try:\n        with open(item_path, \"r\") as f:\n            content = f.read()\n    except IOError:\n        return 0\n\n    return len(re.findall(r\"### Verification #\\d+\", content))\n\n\ndef last_verification_passed(item_path: str) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"Check if the most recent verification entry has Verdict: PASS.\"\"\"\n    try:\n        with open(item_path, \"r\") as f:\n            content = f.read()\n    except IOError:\n        return False\n\n    # Find all verdict lines and check the last one\n    verdicts = re.findall(r\"\\*\\*Verdict:\\s*(PASS|FAIL)\\*\\*\", content, re.IGNORECASE)\n    if not verdicts:\n        return False\n    return verdicts[-1].upper() == \"PASS\"\n\n\ndef verify_item(item: BacklogItem, dry_run: bool = False) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"Run symptom verification on a completed defect fix.\n\n    Returns True if verification passed, False if it failed.\n    The verifier appends findings to the defect file regardless of outcome.\n    \"\"\"\n    if item.item_type != \"defect\":\n        # Features don't have symptom verification (yet)\n        return True\n\n    attempt_count = count_verification_attempts(item.path) + 1\n\n    if dry_run:\n        log(f\"[DRY RUN] Would verify symptoms for: {item.display_name} (attempt #{attempt_count})\")\n        return True\n\n    log(f\"Running symptom verification #{attempt_count}...\")\n\n    prompt = VERIFICATION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE.format(\n        item_path=item.path,\n        slug=item.slug,\n        count=attempt_count,\n        build_command=BUILD_COMMAND,\n        test_command=TEST_COMMAND,\n        dev_server_command=DEV_SERVER_COMMAND,\n    )\n\n    cmd = [*CLAUDE_CMD, \"--dangerously-skip-permissions\", \"--print\", prompt]\n\n    result = run_child_process(\n        cmd,\n        description=f\"Verify {item.slug} #{attempt_count}\",\n        timeout=PLAN_CREATION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS,\n        show_output=VERBOSE,\n    )\n\n    if result.rate_limited:\n        log(\"Rate limited during verification\")\n        return False\n\n    if not result.success:\n        log(f\"Verification process failed (exit {result.exit_code})\")\n        return False\n\n    # Check if the verifier recorded a PASS\n    passed = last_verification_passed(item.path)\n    if passed:\n        log(f\"Verification #{attempt_count}: PASSED\")\n    else:\n        log(f\"Verification #{attempt_count}: FAILED -
