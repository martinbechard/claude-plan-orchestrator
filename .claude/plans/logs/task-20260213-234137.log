The overhead of spawning a validator agent for every task would double execution time. Plans that benefit from validation (e.g., defect fixes, critical infrastructure) opt in explicitly.\n   179→\n   180→2. **Validators run sequentially after parallel tasks.** Running validators in parallel with each other could cause conflicting build/test state. Sequential validation is safer and the overhead is acceptable since validation is lighter than implementation.\n   181→\n   182→3. **Retry-with-findings uses a task field, not an external file.** The validation findings are stored in task[\"validation_findings\"] in the plan YAML. This keeps all task state in one place and survives orchestrator restarts.\n   183→\n   184→4. **The validator agent reuses the VERIFICATION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE output format.** The PASS/WARN/FAIL verdict and structured findings format is already proven in the auto-pipeline verifier. Reusing it means parsing logic can be shared.\n   185→\n   186→5. **WARN does not trigger a retry.** Warnings are informational (e.g., \"missing docstring\", \"could improve naming\"). Only FAIL triggers a retry. This prevents infinite validation loops over style nits.\n   187→\n   188→6. **max_validation_attempts defaults to 1.** A task gets at most one validation-triggered retry by default. This prevents runaway validate-fix cycles. Combined with the existing max_attempts per task, the total attempts remain bounded.\n   189→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"c35fda59-1a3b-4585-9633-c74049b22833","uuid":"9fd272ec-0bab-4619-add4-cb82e55fa2b4","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/Users/martinbechard/dev/claude-plan-orchestrator/docs/plans/2026-02-13-03-per-task-validation-pipeline-design.md","content":"# Per-Task Validation Pipeline - Design Document\n\n> **For Claude:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use the implement skill to execute this plan task-by-task.\n\n**Goal:** Extend the item-level verify-then-fix cycle to work at the individual task level within the orchestrator, spawning a validator agent after each implementation task to independently verify the result and retrying with findings if validation fails.\n\n**Architecture:** After a coder task completes successfully, the orchestrator optionally spawns a validation pass using the validator agent.

Extracts the validation findings\n2. Prepends them to the task prompt for the next attempt\n3. The prepended block uses this format:\n\n        ## PREVIOUS VALIDATION FAILED\n\n        The previous attempt at this task was completed but failed validation.\n        You must address these findings:\n\n        {validation_findings}\n\n        ---\n\nThis is stored in a new task field: task[\"validation_findings\"] which build_claude_prompt() checks and includes if present.\n\n### Orchestrator Integration Points\n\n1. **run_orchestrator() sequential block (line ~2049):** After task_result.success is confirmed, check if validation is enabled for this task's agent type. If so, run the validation pass.\n\n2. **run_orchestrator() parallel block (line ~1830):** After parallel results are collected, validate each successful task sequentially (validators should not run in parallel to avoid conflicting state).\n\n3. **build_claude_prompt() (line ~1198):** Check for task[\"validation_findings\"] and prepend them to the prompt.\n\n---\n\n## Key Files\n\n### New Files\n\n| File | Purpose |\n|------|---------|\n| .claude/agents/validator.md | Post-task verification coordinator agent |\n| .claude/agents/issue-verifier.md | Defect fix verification specialist agent |\n\n### Modified Files\n\n| File | Change |\n|------|--------|\n| scripts/plan-orchestrator.py | Add ValidationConfig, ValidationVerdict, validation logic in task loop |\n\n---\n\n## Design Decisions\n\n1. **Validation is opt-in via plan meta.** Most plans do not need per-task validation. The overhead of spawning a validator agent for every task would double execution time. Plans that benefit from validation (e.g., defect fixes, critical infrastructure) opt in explicitly.\n\n2. **Validators run sequentially after parallel tasks.** Running validators in parallel with each other could cause conflicting build/test state. Sequential validation is safer and the overhead is acceptable since validation is lighter than implementation.\n\n3. **Retry-with-findings uses a task field, not an external file.** The validation findings are stored in task[\"validation_findings\"] in the plan YAML. This keeps all task state in one place and survives orchestrator restarts.\n\n4. **The validator agent reuses the VERIFICATION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE output format.** The PASS/WARN/FAIL verdict and structured findings format is already proven in the auto-pipeline verifier. Reusing it means parsing logic can be shared.\n\n5. **WARN does not trigger a retry.** Warnings are informational (e.g., \"missing docstring\", \"could improve naming\"). Only FAIL triggers a retry. This prevents infinite validation loops over style nits.\n\n6. **max_validation_attempts defaults to 1.** A task gets at most one validation-triggered retry by default. This prevents runaway validate-fix cycles. Combined with the existing max_attempts per task, the total attempts remain bounded.\n","numLines":189,"startLine":1,"totalLines":189}}}
