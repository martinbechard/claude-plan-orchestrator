The user experience changes slightly: instead of raw text stdout, we get JSON. But since non-verbose mode already shows progress dots (not raw output), the display is unaffected. We parse the JSON after process completion.\n\n2. **Use total_cost_usd from CLI, never calculate cost from tokens.** The CLI cost calculation accounts for pricing tiers, model variants, and cache discounts. Recalculating would be fragile and duplicate logic.\n\n3. **PlanUsageTracker lives in plan-orchestrator.py, not a separate module.** The orchestrator is a single-file script by convention. Adding a class to it follows the existing pattern of TaskResult, CircuitBreaker, OutputCollector.\n\n4. **Usage report goes to .claude/plans/logs/ alongside task logs.** This is the natural home for execution artifacts. The report filename includes the plan name for easy identification.\n\n5. **stream_json_output() captures usage data via a shared mutable dict.** Rather than changing the function signature (which would break threading), we pass a dict that it populates with the result event data. This is thread-safe because only the stdout thread writes to it (single writer, reader waits for thread join).\n\n6. **Auto-pipeline reads the usage report file rather than parsing orchestrator stdout.** This is cleaner and avoids fragile stdout parsing. The orchestrator writes the report, the pipeline reads it.\n\n7. **Cache hit rate uses cache_read / (cache_read + input_tokens).** This measures what fraction of input context was served from cache vs. freshly processed. A higher rate means lower cost per token.\n\n8. **parse_task_usage() is a pure function.** Extracting a standalone helper makes it testable without mocking CLI processes. Both verbose and non-verbose paths call the same function.\n","numLines":190,"startLine":1,"totalLines":190}}}
