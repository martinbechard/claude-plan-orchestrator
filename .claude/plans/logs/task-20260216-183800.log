{"type":"user","message":{"role":"user","content":[{"type":"text","text":"Base directory for this skill: /Users/martinbechard/dev/claude-plan-orchestrator/.claude/skills/coding-rules\n\n# Coding Rules (Summary)\n\nThis skill provides a condensed overview of the project's coding standards. Each section\nbelow summarizes a rule category. For the full rules with rationale (the BECAUSE chains)\nand examples, read **CODING-RULES.md** at the project root.\n\n## Rule 0: File Headers and Design Traceability\n\nEvery source file must include a header comment with the file path, a one-line purpose\nsummary, and a reference to the relevant design document. Before modifying code, verify\nchanges against the design document referenced in the header. Design documents are the\nsingle source of truth for module behavior; keep them synchronized with the code.\n\n## Rule 1: Naming Conventions\n\nUse PascalCase for classes, interfaces, types, and React components. Use camelCase for\nvariables, functions, methods, and utility files. Use ALL_CAPS_SNAKE_CASE for manifest\nconstants. Use kebab-case for configuration files. File names must match their primary\nclass or component. Names must be clear, descriptive, and follow Command-Query Separation\n(nouns for queries, verbs for mutations).\n\n## Rule 2: File Organization and Imports\n\nOrganize files into standard directories (src/, scripts/, docs/, tests/). Separate shared\ncontracts (interfaces, types, constants) from implementation. Files exceeding 200 lines\nshould be refactored into a module folder with an entry point that exports only the public\nAPI. Entry points must contain only import/export statements. Organize imports as: external\nlibraries, project aliases, relative imports. Remove unused imports. Avoid circular\ndependencies.\n\n## Rule 3: Code Structure and Readability\n\nMethods should not exceed 30-40 lines; extract complex logic into helpers. Classes should\nnot exceed 300 lines. Functions with more than two parameters must use a parameter object.\nPrioritize code clarity over premature abstraction. Focus on minimal, necessary changes;\navoid over-engineering.\n\n## Rule 4: Type Safety\n\nNever use the any type; create proper typed interfaces. Use interface for contracts, type\nfor data shapes and unions, class when behavior or state is required. Avoid primitive\nobsession; use domain-specific types. Never use literal magic numbers or strings; define\nmanifest constants at the top of the file or in a constants module.\n\n## Rule 5: Coupling and Cohesion\n\nClasses must have a single responsibility (SRP). Methods must perform a single logical\noperation. Depend on interfaces rather than concrete implementations. Do not access private\nmembers of other classes. Avoid Feature Envy (move methods to where the data lives).\nUtility functions used by only one class should be private to that class.\n\n## Rule 6: Error Handling\n\nNever use empty catch blocks; always log or re-throw. Do not use exceptions for control\nflow. Provide clear error messages with context (what was attempted, which values were\ninvolved). Include variable names alongside values in log statements.\n\n## Rule 7: Comments and Documentation\n\nEvery exported symbol must have a doc comment explaining its purpose. Write comments to\nexplain why, not what. Remove commented-out code (use version control). Keep comments\naccurate and up-to-date. Avoid excessive comments; refactor for clarity instead. Remove\nTODO/FIXME comments before task completion; use the YAML plan to track remaining work.\n\n## Rule 11: Test Discipline\n\nRun related tests after any code change. Failing tests are your responsibility; fix them\nimmediately. TypeScript errors in test files count as broken tests. When splitting large\ntest suites, migrate incrementally (one group at a time, verify, continue).\n\n## Rule 12: AI-Specific Discipline\n\nNever remove existing functionality when asked to simplify. Do not add features or\nimprovements beyond what was asked. Show actual state honestly (null, empty, not configured);\nnever invent fallback data.

There is no need for per-plan custom ladders; the three tiers cover all current Claude models. This simplifies configuration and avoids user errors.\n   175→\n   176→2. **EscalationConfig lives on the plan, not per-agent.** While agents have a starting model, the escalation policy (when to escalate, ceiling) is plan-level. This keeps the configuration in one place and avoids conflicting settings across agents in the same plan.\n   177→\n   178→3. **Escalation uses attempt count, not failure type.** The backlog item mentions \"consecutive failures.\" Since the orchestrator already increments task.attempts on each retry, we use that counter directly.

Add an EscalationConfig dataclass parsed from plan YAML meta.model_escalation. Add a compute_effective_model() function that takes the agent's starting model and the task's current attempt count, returning the correct model for this attempt. Pass the effective model to the Claude CLI via the --model flag in all execution paths (sequential, parallel, validation). Add a validation_model override so validators always use a cost-efficient model regardless of escalation.\n\n**Tech Stack:** Python 3 (plan-orchestrator.py), YAML (plan meta.model_escalation configuration), agent frontmatter (escalation overrides)\n\n---\n\n## Architecture Overview\n\n### Dependencies\n\n- Feature 02 (Agent Definition Framework): Agent model field must exist in frontmatter (already implemented)\n- Feature 06 (Token Usage Tracking): Per-task cost tracking for model visibility (already implemented)\n\n### Model Tier Ladder\n\nA fixed, ordered list of model tiers:\n\n    MODEL_TIERS: list[str] = [\"haiku\", \"sonnet\", \"opus\"]\n\nThe ladder defines escalation order. To find the next tier, look up the current model's index and increment by one, capped at the max_model ceiling.\n\n### EscalationConfig Dataclass\n\nNew dataclass to hold escalation configuration, placed after BudgetGuard in plan-orchestrator.py:\n\n    DEFAULT_ESCALATE_AFTER_FAILURES = 2\n    DEFAULT_MAX_MODEL = \"opus\"\n    DEFAULT_VALIDATION_MODEL = \"sonnet\"\n    DEFAULT_STARTING_MODEL = \"sonnet\"\n\n    @dataclass\n    class EscalationConfig:\n        \"\"\"Model escalation configuration for cost-aware tier promotion.\"\"\"\n        enabled: bool = False\n        escalate_after: int = DEFAULT_ESCALATE_AFTER_FAILURES\n        max_model: str = DEFAULT_MAX_MODEL\n        validation_model: str = DEFAULT_VALIDATION_MODEL\n        starting_model: str = DEFAULT_STARTING_MODEL\n\n        def get_effective_model(self, agent_model: str, attempt: int) -> str:\n            \"\"\"Compute the effective model for a given agent and attempt number.\n\n            If escalation is disabled, returns the agent_model unchanged.\n            Otherwise, promotes up the tier ladder based on attempt count.\n            \"\"\"\n            if not self.enabled:\n                return agent_model\n            base = agent_model or self.starting_model\n            if base not in MODEL_TIERS:\n                return base  # Unknown model, don't escalate\n            base_idx = MODEL_TIERS.index(base)\n            max_idx = MODEL_TIERS.index(self.max_model) if self.max_model in MODEL_TIERS else len(MODEL_TIERS) - 1\n            # How many escalation steps?\n            steps = max(0, (attempt - 1) // self.escalate_after)\n            effective_idx = min(base_idx + steps, max_idx)\n            return MODEL_TIERS[effective_idx]\n\nEscalation math:\n- attempt 1..N where N=escalate_after: use base model\n- attempt N+1..2N: use next tier\n- attempt 2N+1..: use next tier again, capped at max_model\n\n### Configuration Sources\n\nConfiguration comes from three places (in priority order):\n\n1. **Plan YAML meta.model_escalation** (plan-level defaults):\n\n       meta:\n         model_escalation:\n           enabled: true\n           escalate_after: 2\n           max_model: opus\n           validation_model: sonnet\n\n2. **Agent frontmatter** (per-agent starting model):\n\n       ---\n       model: sonnet\n       ---\n\n   The agent's model field is used as the starting model for escalation.\n\n3. **Defaults** (if neither plan nor agent specifies): escalation disabled, models unchanged.\n\nPlan-level config controls the escalation behavior. Agent frontmatter controls the starting point. There is no per-agent escalation override in the first version to keep things simple.\n\n### parse_escalation_config Helper\n\n    def parse_escalation_config(plan: dict) -> EscalationConfig:\n        \"\"\"Parse model escalation config from plan YAML meta.\"\"\"\n        esc_meta = plan.get(\"meta\", {}).get(\"model_escalation\", {})\n        if not esc_meta:\n            return EscalationConfig()\n        return EscalationConfig(\n            enabled=esc_meta.get(\"enabled\", False),\n            escalate_after=esc_meta.get(\"escalate_after\", DEFAULT_ESCALATE_AFTER_FAILURES),\n            max_model=esc_meta.get(\"max_model\", DEFAULT_MAX_MODEL),\n            validation_model=esc_meta.get(\"validation_model\", DEFAULT_VALIDATION_MODEL),\n            starting_model=esc_meta.get(\"starting_model\", DEFAULT_STARTING_MODEL),\n        )\n\n### Validation Model Override\n\nValidation agents (code-reviewer, validator, issue-verifier) always use escalation_config.validation_model, ignoring escalation. This is because validators perform structured checks (not open-ended reasoning) where a cheaper model is sufficient.\n\nThe determination of whether an agent is a \"validator\" is based on the existing run_after list in ValidationConfig. If the task's agent name is NOT in run_after, the task itself is a validator.\n\n### run_claude_task Changes\n\nThe key change: run_claude_task() accepts a new optional model parameter:\n\n    def run_claude_task(prompt: str, dry_run: bool = False, model: str = \"\") -> TaskResult:\n\nWhen model is non-empty, add --model {model} to the CLI command:\n\n    cmd = [*CLAUDE_CMD, \"--dangerously-skip-permissions\", \"--print\", prompt]\n    if model:\n        cmd.extend([\"--model\", model])\n\nThis is passed in three execution paths:\n\n1. **Sequential path** (run_orchestrator main loop, line ~2821): Compute effective model before calling run_claude_task()\n2. **Parallel path** (run_parallel_task, line ~1711): Add --model to the subprocess command\n3. **Validation path** (run_validation, which calls run_claude_task): Use validation_model\n\n### Orchestrator Integration\n\nIn run_orchestrator(), before calling run_claude_task for each task:\n\n1. Resolve the agent name and load its definition to get agent_model\n2. Determine if this is a validator task (agent_name NOT in validation_config.run_after):\n   - If validator: effective_model = escalation_config.validation_model\n   - If regular task: effective_model = escalation_config.get_effective_model(agent_model, current_attempts + 1)\n3. Log the model selection: \"Task X.Y attempt N: using {model}\" (or \"escalating from {base} to {model}\" when escalated)\n4. Pass effective_model to run_claude_task()\n\n### Usage Report Enhancement\n\nThe usage report (from Feature 06) already records per-task cost. This feature enhances it by recording the model used per task attempt. Add a model field to the task record in the usage report:\n\n    task[\"model_used\"] = effective_model\n\nAnd record the model in the YAML plan task dict:\n\n    task[\"model_used\"] = effective_model\n\nThis makes the model used visible in both the usage report JSON and the plan YAML.\n\n---\n\n## Key Files\n\n### Modified Files\n\n| File | Change |\n|------|--------|\n| scripts/plan-orchestrator.py | MODEL_TIERS constant, EscalationConfig dataclass, parse_escalation_config, compute_effective_model in get_effective_model method, --model flag in run_claude_task and parallel runner, validation model override, escalation logging, model_used in usage report |\n\n### New Files\n\n| File | Purpose |\n|------|---------|\n| tests/test_model_escalation.py | Unit tests for EscalationConfig, parse_escalation_config, model tier computation |\n\n---\n\n## Design Decisions\n\n1. **Fixed tier ladder, not configurable.** The ladder haiku -> sonnet -> opus is hardcoded. There is no need for per-plan custom ladders; the three tiers cover all current Claude models. This simplifies configuration and avoids user errors.\n\n2. **EscalationConfig lives on the plan, not per-agent.** While agents have a starting model, the escalation policy (when to escalate, ceiling) is plan-level. This keeps the configuration in one place and avoids conflicting settings across agents in the same plan.\n\n3. **Escalation uses attempt count, not failure type.** The backlog item mentions \"consecutive failures.\" Since the orchestrator already increments task.attempts on each retry, we use that counter directly. All failures are treated equally (no distinction between rate limits, timeouts, or logical failures).\n\n4. **Validation model is a separate override, not part of escalation.** Validators are not subject to escalation because they perform deterministic checks. The validation_model setting gives explicit control.\n\n5. **Model flag passed via --model CLI argument.** The Claude CLI supports --model to override the default model. This is the cleanest integration point.\n\n6. **No agent frontmatter changes required.** The existing model field in agent frontmatter already serves as the starting model. No new fields are needed in agent definitions.\n\n7. **model_used recorded in plan YAML for observability.** After each task attempt, the model used is written into the task dict. This provides an audit trail visible in the plan file.\n\n8. **Backwards compatible when disabled.** When meta.model_escalation is absent or enabled: false, the orchestrator behaves exactly as before (no --model flag is passed, Claude uses its default).\n","numLines":189,"startLine":1,"totalLines":189}}}
