Add a BudgetGuard class that checks cumulative cost (from PlanUsageTracker, Feature 06) against the configured ceiling before each task. When spending exceeds the threshold, the orchestrator pauses the plan with a \"paused_quota\" status. The auto-pipeline performs a per-work-item budget check and stops processing new items when the budget is exhausted. No external quota API is required; the system uses locally-tracked cost data combined with a user-configured ceiling.\n\n**Tech Stack:** Python 3 (plan-orchestrator.py, auto-pipeline.py), YAML (plan meta.budget configuration)\n\n---\n\n## Architecture Overview\n\n### Dependency: Feature 06 (Token Usage Tracking)\n\nThis feature builds directly on the TaskUsage dataclass, PlanUsageTracker, and per-task cost data introduced by Feature 06.
