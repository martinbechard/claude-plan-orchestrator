{"type":"user","message":{"role":"user","content":[{"type":"text","text":"Base directory for this skill: /Users/martinbechard/dev/claude-plan-orchestrator/.claude/skills/coding-rules\n\n# Coding Rules (Summary)\n\nThis skill provides a condensed overview of the project's coding standards. Each section\nbelow summarizes a rule category. For the full rules with rationale (the BECAUSE chains)\nand examples, read **CODING-RULES.md** at the project root.\n\n## Rule 0: File Headers and Design Traceability\n\nEvery source file must include a header comment with the file path, a one-line purpose\nsummary, and a reference to the relevant design document. Before modifying code, verify\nchanges against the design document referenced in the header. Design documents are the\nsingle source of truth for module behavior; keep them synchronized with the code.\n\n## Rule 1: Naming Conventions\n\nUse PascalCase for classes, interfaces, types, and React components. Use camelCase for\nvariables, functions, methods, and utility files. Use ALL_CAPS_SNAKE_CASE for manifest\nconstants. Use kebab-case for configuration files. File names must match their primary\nclass or component. Names must be clear, descriptive, and follow Command-Query Separation\n(nouns for queries, verbs for mutations).\n\n## Rule 2: File Organization and Imports\n\nOrganize files into standard directories (src/, scripts/, docs/, tests/). Separate shared\ncontracts (interfaces, types, constants) from implementation. Files exceeding 200 lines\nshould be refactored into a module folder with an entry point that exports only the public\nAPI. Entry points must contain only import/export statements. Organize imports as: external\nlibraries, project aliases, relative imports. Remove unused imports. Avoid circular\ndependencies.\n\n## Rule 3: Code Structure and Readability\n\nMethods should not exceed 30-40 lines; extract complex logic into helpers. Classes should\nnot exceed 300 lines. Functions with more than two parameters must use a parameter object.\nPrioritize code clarity over premature abstraction. Focus on minimal, necessary changes;\navoid over-engineering.\n\n## Rule 4: Type Safety\n\nNever use the any type; create proper typed interfaces. Use interface for contracts, type\nfor data shapes and unions, class when behavior or state is required. Avoid primitive\nobsession; use domain-specific types. Never use literal magic numbers or strings; define\nmanifest constants at the top of the file or in a constants module.\n\n## Rule 5: Coupling and Cohesion\n\nClasses must have a single responsibility (SRP). Methods must perform a single logical\noperation. Depend on interfaces rather than concrete implementations. Do not access private\nmembers of other classes. Avoid Feature Envy (move methods to where the data lives).\nUtility functions used by only one class should be private to that class.\n\n## Rule 6: Error Handling\n\nNever use empty catch blocks; always log or re-throw. Do not use exceptions for control\nflow. Provide clear error messages with context (what was attempted, which values were\ninvolved). Include variable names alongside values in log statements.\n\n## Rule 7: Comments and Documentation\n\nEvery exported symbol must have a doc comment explaining its purpose. Write comments to\nexplain why, not what. Remove commented-out code (use version control). Keep comments\naccurate and up-to-date. Avoid excessive comments; refactor for clarity instead. Remove\nTODO/FIXME comments before task completion; use the YAML plan to track remaining work.\n\n## Rule 11: Test Discipline\n\nRun related tests after any code change. Failing tests are your responsibility; fix them\nimmediately. TypeScript errors in test files count as broken tests. When splitting large\ntest suites, migrate incrementally (one group at a time, verify, continue).\n\n## Rule 12: AI-Specific Discipline\n\nNever remove existing functionality when asked to simplify. Do not add features or\nimprovements beyond what was asked. Show actual state honestly (null, empty, not configured);\nnever invent fallback data.

Currently the orchestrator only uses structured output in verbose mode (--output-format stream-json). In non-verbose mode it uses plain text, which discards usage data.\n    34→\n    35→**Non-verbose mode change:** Add --output-format json to the CLI command. After the process completes, parse the final stdout as JSON to extract the result object containing usage fields. The \"progress dots\" display remains unchanged because dots are driven by byte counts, not by parsing stdout content.\n    36→\n    37→**Verbose mode change:** Modify stream_json_output() to capture and return the result event data. Currently it parses the result event (line 1803) and prints cost/duration/turns, but discards the data. Change: pass a mutable dict into the function; when the result event arrives, store it there.

Modify run_claude_task() to always use structured JSON output from the Claude CLI, parse the result event, and populate TaskUsage on every TaskResult. Add a PlanUsageTracker to accumulate per-task usage into section-level and plan-level totals. Write a usage-report.json alongside plan logs when the plan completes. Enhance per-task log files with usage data.\n\n**Tech Stack:** Python 3 (plan-orchestrator.py, auto-pipeline.py), JSON (CLI output parsing, usage report), YAML (plan files)\n\n---\n\n## Architecture Overview\n\n### TaskUsage Dataclass\n\nNew dataclass added alongside TaskResult in plan-orchestrator.py:\n\n    @dataclass\n    class TaskUsage:\n        input_tokens: int = 0\n        output_tokens: int = 0\n        cache_read_tokens: int = 0\n        cache_creation_tokens: int = 0\n        total_cost_usd: float = 0.0\n        num_turns: int = 0\n        duration_api_ms: int = 0\n\nTaskResult gets an optional field:\n\n    usage: Optional[TaskUsage] = None\n\n### CLI Output Capture Strategy\n\nThe Claude CLI provides full usage data in its JSON output. Currently the orchestrator only uses structured output in verbose mode (--output-format stream-json). In non-verbose mode it uses plain text, which discards usage data.\n\n**Non-verbose mode change:** Add --output-format json to the CLI command. After the process completes, parse the final stdout as JSON to extract the result object containing usage fields. The \"progress dots\" display remains unchanged because dots are driven by byte counts, not by parsing stdout content.\n\n**Verbose mode change:** Modify stream_json_output() to capture and return the result event data. Currently it parses the result event (line 1803) and prints cost/duration/turns, but discards the data. Change: pass a mutable dict into the function; when the result event arrives, store it there. After the thread joins, run_claude_task() reads the dict.\n\n**Both paths produce a TaskUsage** that is attached to the returned TaskResult.\n\n### Usage Extraction\n\nFrom the CLI result JSON:\n\n    input_tokens = result.get(\"usage\", {}).get(\"input_tokens\", 0)\n    output_tokens = result.get(\"usage\", {}).get(\"output_tokens\", 0)\n    cache_read_tokens = result.get(\"usage\", {}).get(\"cache_read_input_tokens\", 0)\n    cache_creation_tokens = result.get(\"usage\", {}).get(\"cache_creation_input_tokens\", 0)\n    total_cost_usd = result.get(\"total_cost_usd\", 0.0)\n    num_turns = result.get(\"num_turns\", 0)\n    duration_api_ms = result.get(\"duration_api_ms\", 0)\n\nThe total_cost_usd field is authoritative (not calculated from tokens).\n\n### Helper: parse_task_usage()\n\nA standalone function that takes a result dict and returns a TaskUsage:\n\n    def parse_task_usage(result_data: dict) -> TaskUsage:\n        usage = result_data.get(\"usage\", {})\n        return TaskUsage(\n            input_tokens=usage.get(\"input_tokens\", 0),\n            output_tokens=usage.get(\"output_tokens\", 0),\n            cache_read_tokens=usage.get(\"cache_read_input_tokens\", 0),\n            cache_creation_tokens=usage.get(\"cache_creation_input_tokens\", 0),\n            total_cost_usd=result_data.get(\"total_cost_usd\", 0.0),\n            num_turns=result_data.get(\"num_turns\", 0),\n            duration_api_ms=result_data.get(\"duration_api_ms\", 0),\n        )\n\n### PlanUsageTracker\n\nA class that accumulates usage across all tasks:\n\n    class PlanUsageTracker:\n        def __init__(self):\n            self.task_usages: dict[str, TaskUsage] = {}\n\n        def record(self, task_id: str, usage: TaskUsage) -> None\n        def get_section_usage(self, plan: dict, section_id: str) -> TaskUsage\n        def get_total_usage(self) -> TaskUsage\n        def get_cache_hit_rate(self) -> float\n        def format_summary_line(self, task_id: str) -> str\n        def format_final_summary(self, plan: dict) -> str\n\nCache hit rate: cache_read_tokens / (cache_read_tokens + input_tokens) when denominator > 0, else 0.\n\n### Summary Output\n\nAfter each task completes, print a usage summary line:\n\n    [Usage] Task 1.1: $0.0234 | 1,234 in / 567 out / 890 cached (72% cache hit) | Running: $0.0456\n\nAfter all tasks complete, print a final summary:\n\n    === Usage Summary ===\n    Total cost: $0.1234\n    Total tokens: 12,345 input / 5,678 output\n    Cache: 8,901 read / 2,345 created (72% hit rate)\n    API time: 45.6s across 12 turns\n    Per-section breakdown:\n      Phase 1: $0.0456 (3 tasks)\n      Phase 2: $0.0778 (2 tasks)\n\n### Usage Report File\n\nAfter plan completion, write .claude/plans/logs/{plan-name}-usage-report.json:\n\n    {\n      \"plan_name\": \"Token Usage Tracking\",\n      \"completed_at\": \"2026-02-13T15:30:00\",\n      \"total\": {\n        \"cost_usd\": 0.1234,\n        \"input_tokens\": 12345,\n        \"output_tokens\": 5678,\n        \"cache_read_tokens\": 8901,\n        \"cache_creation_tokens\": 2345,\n        \"cache_hit_rate\": 0.72,\n        \"num_turns\": 12,\n        \"duration_api_ms\": 45600\n      },\n      \"sections\": [\n        {\"id\": \"phase-1\", \"name\": \"Phase 1\", \"cost_usd\": 0.0456, \"task_count\": 3},\n        ...\n      ],\n      \"tasks\": [\n        {\"id\": \"1.1\", \"name\": \"Task name\", \"cost_usd\": 0.0123, ...},\n        ...\n      ]\n    }\n\n### Log File Enhancement\n\nThe existing per-task log files (.claude/plans/logs/task-*.log) get additional lines in the header:\n\n    === Claude Task Output ===\n    Timestamp: 2026-02-13T15:30:00\n    Duration: 45.6s\n    Return code: 0\n    Cost: $0.0123\n    Tokens: 1234 input / 567 output / 890 cache_read / 234 cache_create\n    Turns: 5\n    API time: 12345ms\n\n### Auto-Pipeline Integration\n\nThe auto-pipeline invokes the orchestrator as a child process.

After execute_plan() returns, read the usage report JSON if it exists\n2. Accumulate per-work-item totals (plan creation + orchestrator execution)\n3.
