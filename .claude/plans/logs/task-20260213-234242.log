{"type":"user","message":{"role":"user","content":[{"type":"text","text":"Base directory for this skill: /Users/martinbechard/dev/claude-plan-orchestrator/.claude/skills/coding-rules\n\n# Coding Rules (Summary)\n\nThis skill provides a condensed overview of the project's coding standards. Each section\nbelow summarizes a rule category. For the full rules with rationale (the BECAUSE chains)\nand examples, read **CODING-RULES.md** at the project root.\n\n## Rule 0: File Headers and Design Traceability\n\nEvery source file must include a header comment with the file path, a one-line purpose\nsummary, and a reference to the relevant design document. Before modifying code, verify\nchanges against the design document referenced in the header. Design documents are the\nsingle source of truth for module behavior; keep them synchronized with the code.\n\n## Rule 1: Naming Conventions\n\nUse PascalCase for classes, interfaces, types, and React components. Use camelCase for\nvariables, functions, methods, and utility files. Use ALL_CAPS_SNAKE_CASE for manifest\nconstants. Use kebab-case for configuration files. File names must match their primary\nclass or component. Names must be clear, descriptive, and follow Command-Query Separation\n(nouns for queries, verbs for mutations).\n\n## Rule 2: File Organization and Imports\n\nOrganize files into standard directories (src/, scripts/, docs/, tests/). Separate shared\ncontracts (interfaces, types, constants) from implementation. Files exceeding 200 lines\nshould be refactored into a module folder with an entry point that exports only the public\nAPI. Entry points must contain only import/export statements. Organize imports as: external\nlibraries, project aliases, relative imports. Remove unused imports. Avoid circular\ndependencies.\n\n## Rule 3: Code Structure and Readability\n\nMethods should not exceed 30-40 lines; extract complex logic into helpers. Classes should\nnot exceed 300 lines. Functions with more than two parameters must use a parameter object.\nPrioritize code clarity over premature abstraction. Focus on minimal, necessary changes;\navoid over-engineering.\n\n## Rule 4: Type Safety\n\nNever use the any type; create proper typed interfaces. Use interface for contracts, type\nfor data shapes and unions, class when behavior or state is required. Avoid primitive\nobsession; use domain-specific types. Never use literal magic numbers or strings; define\nmanifest constants at the top of the file or in a constants module.\n\n## Rule 5: Coupling and Cohesion\n\nClasses must have a single responsibility (SRP). Methods must perform a single logical\noperation. Depend on interfaces rather than concrete implementations. Do not access private\nmembers of other classes. Avoid Feature Envy (move methods to where the data lives).\nUtility functions used by only one class should be private to that class.\n\n## Rule 6: Error Handling\n\nNever use empty catch blocks; always log or re-throw. Do not use exceptions for control\nflow. Provide clear error messages with context (what was attempted, which values were\ninvolved). Include variable names alongside values in log statements.\n\n## Rule 7: Comments and Documentation\n\nEvery exported symbol must have a doc comment explaining its purpose. Write comments to\nexplain why, not what. Remove commented-out code (use version control). Keep comments\naccurate and up-to-date. Avoid excessive comments; refactor for clarity instead. Remove\nTODO/FIXME comments before task completion; use the YAML plan to track remaining work.\n\n## Rule 11: Test Discipline\n\nRun related tests after any code change. Failing tests are your responsibility; fix them\nimmediately. TypeScript errors in test files count as broken tests. When splitting large\ntest suites, migrate incrementally (one group at a time, verify, continue).\n\n## Rule 12: AI-Specific Discipline\n\nNever remove existing functionality when asked to simplify. Do not add features or\nimprovements beyond what was asked. Show actual state honestly (null, empty, not configured);\nnever invent fallback data. Never defer work because a file is too large; split and\nintegrate immediately.

Sequential validation is safer and the overhead is acceptable since validation is lighter than implementation.\n   181→\n   182→3. **Retry-with-findings uses a task field, not an external file.** The validation findings are stored in task[\"validation_findings\"] in the plan YAML. This keeps all task state in one place and survives orchestrator restarts.\n   183→\n   184→4. **The validator agent reuses the VERIFICATION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE output format.** The PASS/WARN/FAIL verdict and structured findings format is already proven in the auto-pipeline verifier. Reusing it means parsing logic can be shared.\n   185→\n   186→5. **WARN does not trigger a retry.** Warnings are informational (e.g., \"missing docstring\", \"could improve naming\"). Only FAIL triggers a retry. This prevents infinite validation loops over style nits.\n   187→\n   188→6. **max_validation_attempts defaults to 1.** A task gets at most one validation-triggered retry by default. This prevents runaway validate-fix cycles. Combined with the existing max_attempts per task, the total attempts remain bounded.\n   189→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"72564968-bb34-4ec1-99bc-7777ce502710","uuid":"1d2683a4-2ff8-43f6-a221-3aac1e0821db","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/Users/martinbechard/dev/claude-plan-orchestrator/docs/plans/2026-02-13-03-per-task-validation-pipeline-design.md","content":"# Per-Task Validation Pipeline - Design Document\n\n> **For Claude:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use the implement skill to execute this plan task-by-task.\n\n**Goal:** Extend the item-level verify-then-fix cycle to work at the individual task level within the orchestrator, spawning a validator agent after each implementation task to independently verify the result and retrying with findings if validation fails.\n\n**Architecture:** After a coder task completes successfully, the orchestrator optionally spawns a validation pass using the validator agent.

The prepended block uses this format:\n\n        ## PREVIOUS VALIDATION FAILED\n\n        The previous attempt at this task was completed but failed validation.\n        You must address these findings:\n\n        {validation_findings}\n\n        ---\n\nThis is stored in a new task field: task[\"validation_findings\"] which build_claude_prompt() checks and includes if present.\n\n### Orchestrator Integration Points\n\n1. **run_orchestrator() sequential block (line ~2049):** After task_result.success is confirmed, check if validation is enabled for this task's agent type. If so, run the validation pass.\n\n2. **run_orchestrator() parallel block (line ~1830):** After parallel results are collected, validate each successful task sequentially (validators should not run in parallel to avoid conflicting state).\n\n3. **build_claude_prompt() (line ~1198):** Check for task[\"validation_findings\"] and prepend them to the prompt.\n\n---\n\n## Key Files\n\n### New Files\n\n| File | Purpose |\n|------|---------|\n| .claude/agents/validator.md | Post-task verification coordinator agent |\n| .claude/agents/issue-verifier.md | Defect fix verification specialist agent |\n\n### Modified Files\n\n| File | Change |\n|------|--------|\n| scripts/plan-orchestrator.py | Add ValidationConfig, ValidationVerdict, validation logic in task loop |\n\n---\n\n## Design Decisions\n\n1. **Validation is opt-in via plan meta.** Most plans do not need per-task validation. The overhead of spawning a validator agent for every task would double execution time. Plans that benefit from validation (e.g., defect fixes, critical infrastructure) opt in explicitly.\n\n2. **Validators run sequentially after parallel tasks.** Running validators in parallel with each other could cause conflicting build/test state. Sequential validation is safer and the overhead is acceptable since validation is lighter than implementation.\n\n3. **Retry-with-findings uses a task field, not an external file.** The validation findings are stored in task[\"validation_findings\"] in the plan YAML. This keeps all task state in one place and survives orchestrator restarts.\n\n4. **The validator agent reuses the VERIFICATION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE output format.** The PASS/WARN/FAIL verdict and structured findings format is already proven in the auto-pipeline verifier. Reusing it means parsing logic can be shared.\n\n5. **WARN does not trigger a retry.** Warnings are informational (e.g., \"missing docstring\", \"could improve naming\"). Only FAIL triggers a retry. This prevents infinite validation loops over style nits.\n\n6. **max_validation_attempts defaults to 1.** A task gets at most one validation-triggered retry by default. This prevents runaway validate-fix cycles. Combined with the existing max_attempts per task, the total attempts remain bounded.\n","numLines":189,"startLine":1,"totalLines":189}}}

Read the backlog item file: {item_path}\n2. Read procedure-coding-rules.md for coding standards\n3. Read an existing YAML plan for format reference: look at .claude/plans/*.yaml files\n4. Read the CLAUDE.md file for project conventions\n5. If the backlog item has a ## Verification Log section, READ IT CAREFULLY.\n   Previous fix attempts and their verification results are recorded there.\n   Your plan MUST address any unresolved findings from prior verifications.\n\n## What to produce\n\n1. Create a design document at: docs/plans/{date}-{slug}-design.md\n   - Brief architecture overview\n   - Key files to create/modify\n   - Design decisions\n\n2. Create a YAML plan at: .claude/plans/{slug}.yaml\n   - Use the exact format: meta + sections with nested tasks\n   - Each section has: id, name, status: pending, tasks: [...]\n   - Each task has: id, name, description, status: pending\n   - Task descriptions should be detailed enough for a fresh Claude session to execute\n   - Include: documentation tasks, implementation tasks, unit tests, verification\n   - The verification task should run {build_command} and {test_command}\n\n3. Validate the plan: python scripts/plan-orchestrator.py --plan .claude/plans/{slug}.yaml --dry-run\n   - If validation fails, fix the YAML format and retry\n\n4. Git commit both files with message: \"plan: add {slug} design and YAML plan\"\n\n## Backlog item type: {item_type}\n\n## Agent Selection\n\nTasks can specify which agent should execute them via the optional \"agent\" field.\nAvailable agents are in {agents_dir}:\n\n- **coder**: Implementation specialist. Use for coding, implementation, and\n  modification tasks. This is the default if no agent is specified.\n- **code-reviewer**: Read-only reviewer. Use for verification, review, and\n  compliance-checking tasks.\n\nExample:\n  - id: '2.1'\n    name: Implement the feature\n    agent: coder\n    status: pending\n    description: ...\n\n  - id: '3.1'\n    name: Review code quality\n    agent: code-reviewer\n    status: pending\n    description: ...\n\nIf you do not set the agent field, the orchestrator will infer it from the\ntask description (verification tasks get code-reviewer, everything else gets coder).\n\n## Important\n- Follow the CLAUDE.md change workflow order: docs -> code -> tests -> verification\n- For defects: include a task to verify the fix with a regression test\n- For features: include documentation, implementation, unit tests, and E2E tests as appropriate\n- Keep tasks focused - each task should be completable in one Claude session (under 10 minutes)\n- If the backlog item has a ## Verification Log with unresolved findings, your plan\n  must specifically address those findings. The previous code fix may be correct but\n  incomplete (e.g., operational steps not executed, data not deployed).\n\"\"\"\n\n\ndef reset_interrupted_tasks(plan_path: str) -> int:\n    \"\"\"Reset in_progress tasks back to pending and clear their attempt counters.\n\n    When the pipeline is killed mid-task, the orchestrator leaves tasks as\n    'in_progress'.

Read the backlog item file: {item_path}\n2. Read procedure-coding-rules.md for coding standards\n3. Read an existing YAML plan for format reference: look at .claude/plans/*.yaml files\n4. Read the CLAUDE.md file for project conventions\n5. If the backlog item has a ## Verification Log section, READ IT CAREFULLY.\n   Previous fix attempts and their verification results are recorded there.\n   Your plan MUST address any unresolved findings from prior verifications.\n\n## What to produce\n\n1. Create a design document at: docs/plans/{date}-{slug}-design.md\n   - Brief architecture overview\n   - Key files to create/modify\n   - Design decisions\n\n2. Create a YAML plan at: .claude/plans/{slug}.yaml\n   - Use the exact format: meta + sections with nested tasks\n   - Each section has: id, name, status: pending, tasks: [...]\n   - Each task has: id, name, description, status: pending\n   - Task descriptions should be detailed enough for a fresh Claude session to execute\n   - Include: documentation tasks, implementation tasks, unit tests, verification\n   - The verification task should run {build_command} and {test_command}\n\n3. Validate the plan: python scripts/plan-orchestrator.py --plan .claude/plans/{slug}.yaml --dry-run\n   - If validation fails, fix the YAML format and retry\n\n4.

Use for coding, implementation, and\n  modification tasks. This is the default if no agent is specified.\n- **code-reviewer**: Read-only reviewer. Use for verification, review, and\n  compliance-checking tasks.\n\nExample:\n  - id: '2.1'\n    name: Implement the feature\n    agent: coder\n    status: pending\n    description: ...\n\n  - id: '3.1'\n    name: Review code quality\n    agent: code-reviewer\n    status: pending\n    description: ...\n\nIf you do not set the agent field, the orchestrator will infer it from the\ntask description (verification tasks get code-reviewer, everything else gets coder).\n\n## Important\n- Follow the CLAUDE.md change workflow order: docs -> code -> tests -> verification\n- For defects: include a task to verify the fix with a regression test\n- For features: include documentation, implementation, unit tests, and E2E tests as appropriate\n- Keep tasks focused - each task should be completable in one Claude session (under 10 minutes)\n- If the backlog item has a ## Verification Log with unresolved findings, your plan\n  must specifically address those findings. The previous code fix may be correct but\n  incomplete (e.g., operational steps not executed, data not deployed).\n\"\"\"\n\n\ndef reset_interrupted_tasks(plan_path: str) -> int:\n    \"\"\"Reset in_progress tasks back to pending and clear their attempt counters.\n\n    When the pipeline is killed mid-task, the orchestrator leaves tasks as\n    'in_progress'.
