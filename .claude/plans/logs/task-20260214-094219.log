File Headers and Design Traceability\n    12→\n    13→- **RULE:** Every source file MUST include a header comment with:\n    14→  - File path (relative to project root)\n    15→  - One-line summary of the file's purpose\n    16→  - Reference to the design document that defines its behavior (if one exists)\n    17→  - **BECAUSE:** Headers create an explicit link between implementation and specification,\n    18→    preventing architectural drift.\n    19→  - **BECAUSE:** When an AI agent picks up a task in a fresh session, the header tells it\n    20→    where to find the design context without searching.\n    21→\n    22→- **RULE:** Before modifying existing code, ALWAYS verify changes against the design document\n    23→  referenced in the header. If there is a discrepancy, raise the issue rather than silently\n    24→  diverging.\n    25→  - **BECAUSE:** Ensures implementation continues to align with the agreed-upon specification.\n    26→  - **BECAUSE:** Catches unintended deviations early, before they cascade.\n    27→\n    28→- **RULE:** Major design changes or significant refactorings MUST be discussed and approved\n    29→  before implementation.\n    30→  - **BECAUSE:** Prevents costly rework if changes are later deemed undesirable.\n    31→  - **BECAUSE:** In an orchestrated plan, one agent's unauthorized design change can break\n    32→    assumptions held by subsequent tasks.\n    33→\n    34→- **RULE:** Design documents are the single source of truth for module behavior. When changing\n    35→  code, the corresponding design doc MUST be updated to reflect the changes. Conversely, when\n    36→  code seems incorrect, consult the design doc to understand the intended behavior.\n    37→  - **BECAUSE:** Synchronized design and code reduces confusion and prevents drift.\n    38→  - **BECAUSE:** Design documents provide essential context for recovering intended behavior.\n    39→\n    40→- **RULE:** After implementing changes and ensuring tests pass, ALWAYS perform a code review\n    41→  (manual or automated) against the project's standards.\n    42→  - **BECAUSE:** Code reviews catch issues that tests cannot: readability, maintainability,\n    43→    adherence to conventions, and subtle logic errors.\n    44→\n    45→## 1. Naming Conventions\n    46→\n    47→- **RULE:** Follow your language's community conventions consistently:\n    48→  - **PascalCase** for classes, interfaces, type definitions, React components\n    49→  - **camelCase** for variables, functions, methods, utility files\n    50→  - **ALL_CAPS_SNAKE_CASE** for manifest constants (values that never change at runtime)\n    51→  - **kebab-case** for configuration files and non-code assets\n    52→  - **BECAUSE:** Predictable naming reduces cognitive load. You can tell a file's purpose\n    53→    from its casing alone.\n    54→\n    55→- **RULE:** File names containing a single primary class or component MUST be named to match\n    56→  that class (e.g., `StatusManager.ts` for class `StatusManager`).\n    57→  - **BECAUSE:** Creates a predictable mapping between the artifact and the filesystem,\n    58→    reducing time spent searching for definitions.\n    59→\n    60→- **RULE:** Variable, function, and method names MUST be clear, descriptive, and reflect their\n    61→  purpose. Avoid cryptic abbreviations or overly generic names (e.g., `data`, `manager`, `temp`).\n    62→  - **BECAUSE:** The name itself should convey intent and nature, reducing the need for\n    63→    comments and preventing ambiguity.\n    64→\n    65→- **RULE:** Function/method names SHOULD indicate their purpose through word choice:\n    66→  - **Nouns/noun phrases** for functions that retrieve without side effects:\n    67→    `orderCount`, `getUserProfile`, `isActive`\n    68→  - **Verbs/verb phrases** for functions that alter state or perform actions:\n    69→    `updateStatus`, `calculateTotal`, `saveConfiguration`\n    70→  - **BECAUSE:** Signals to the reader whether calling the function might change system state.\n    71→    This is the Command-Query Separation principle.\n    72→\n    73→- **RULE:** Avoid variable names that are easily confused (e.g., `orderCount` vs `orderCounts`\n    74→  for different concepts). Be precise.\n    75→  - **BECAUSE:** Subtle naming differences for distinct concepts lead to hard-to-find bugs.\n    76→\n    77→- **RULE:** Naming conventions MUST be applied consistently across the entire codebase.\n    78→  - **BECAUSE:** A uniform style makes the codebase feel cohesive and easier to navigate.\n    79→\n    80→## 2. File Organization and Imports\n    81→\n    82→- **RULE:** Organize files into standard top-level directories based on their category:\n    83→  - `src/` - All primary source code\n    84→  - `scripts/` - Utility scripts for build, deployment, development tasks\n    85→  - `docs/` - Documentation, design documents, plans\n    86→  - `test/` or `tests/` - Test code, mocks, fixtures\n    87→  - **BECAUSE:** Establishes a conventional structure that makes it easy to locate artifacts\n    88→    and clearly separates source from supporting files.\n    89→\n    90→- **RULE:** Separate shared contracts from implementation:\n    91→  - Shared interfaces/types/constants should live in dedicated directories\n    92→    (e.g., `src/interfaces/`, `src/types/`, `src/constants/`)\n    93→  - Items used only within a single module may remain co-located in that module\n    94→  - **BECAUSE:** Centralizing shared contracts improves discoverability and prevents\n    95→    scattering definitions across modules.\n    96→  - **BECAUSE:** Clearly separates public API contracts from internal implementation details.\n    97→\n    98→- **RULE:** Any single source file exceeding 200 lines SHOULD be refactored into a module\n    99→  folder with an entry point (`index.ts`, `__init__.py`, etc.) that exports only the\n   100→  public API.\n   101→  - **BECAUSE:** Prevents excessively long files that are hard to read, understand, and maintain.\n   102→  - **BECAUSE:** Enforces a clear public API for each component.\n   103→\n   104→- **RULE:** Module entry points (e.g., `index.ts`) MUST only contain import/export statements.\n   105→  No implementation logic.\n   106→  - **BECAUSE:** The entry point defines the public contract. Mixing in logic blurs the boundary.\n   107→\n   108→- **RULE:** Each exported class SHOULD reside in its own distinct file.\n   109→  - **BECAUSE:** One file, one purpose. Makes code review and maintenance simpler.\n   110→\n   111→- **RULE:** Test files MUST mirror the source directory structure.\n   112→  - **EXAMPLE:** Tests for `src/services/workflow/Executor.ts` go in\n   113→    `test/services/workflow/Executor.test.ts`.\n   114→  - **BECAUSE:** Clear, predictable relationship between code and its tests.\n   115→\n   116→- **RULE:** Before creating a new file for a type, interface, or class, check whether a\n   117→  suitable definition already exists. If it does, import it. If it does not, create it in\n   118→  the correct location and register it in whatever central registry the project uses.\n   119→  - **BECAUSE:** Prevents duplication and ensures a single source of truth for definitions.\n   120→\n   121→- **RULE:** Organize imports logically: external libraries first, then project-level aliases,\n   122→  then relative imports. Remove all unused imports.\n   123→  - **BECAUSE:** Consistent organization improves readability and makes dependencies clearer.\n   124→  - **BECAUSE:** Unused imports clutter code and can cause confusion during refactoring.\n   125→\n   126→- **RULE:** Actively avoid and resolve circular dependencies between modules.\n   127→  - **BECAUSE:** Circular dependencies cause runtime errors, make code harder to test,\n   128→    and hinder modularity. Separating contracts into shared directories can break cycles.\n   129→\n   130→## 3. Code Structure and Readability\n   131→\n   132→- **RULE:** Methods SHOULD NOT exceed 30-40 lines. Extract complex logic into helper methods.\n   133→  - **BECAUSE:** Shorter methods are easier to understand, test, and maintain. They tend to\n   134→    have a single responsibility.\n   135→\n   136→- **RULE:** Classes SHOULD NOT exceed 300 lines. If a class grows beyond this, refactor into\n   137→  a module folder.\n   138→  - **BECAUSE:** Large classes often violate the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and\n   139→    are hard to manage.\n   140→\n   141→- **RULE:** Functions accepting more than two parameters MUST use a parameter object.\n   142→  Name the type descriptively (e.g., `CreateUserParams`, `SearchOptions`).\n   143→  - **BECAUSE:** Parameter objects improve readability and maintainability, especially when\n   144→    adding or removing parameters.\n   145→\n   146→- **RULE:** Prioritize code clarity and correctness over premature abstraction. Apply\n   147→  abstractions when patterns are clear, not speculatively.\n   148→  - **BECAUSE:** Maintainability and understandability come first. Three similar lines are\n   149→    better than a premature abstraction that nobody understands.\n   150→\n   151→- **RULE:** Focus on minimal, necessary changes to achieve the goal. Avoid over-engineering.\n   152→  - **BECAUSE:** Simpler solutions are easier to understand, test, and maintain.\n   153→  - **BECAUSE:** Minimizing scope reduces the risk of unintended side effects.\n   154→  - **BECAUSE:** In orchestrated plans, each task should do one thing well. Gold-plating\n   155→    delays the plan and introduces risk.\n   156→\n   157→## 4. Types and Type Safety\n   158→\n   159→- **RULE:** Never use `any` as a type. Always create proper types for groups of fields.\n   160→  TypeScript is all about types; using `any` defeats the purpose.\n   161→  - **BECAUSE:** `any` bypasses all type checking, hiding bugs that the compiler would\n   162→    otherwise catch.\n   163→\n   164→- **RULE:** Use the correct construct for the purpose:\n   165→  - `interface` for contracts that classes can implement or objects must adhere to\n   166→  - `type` for data shapes, function signatures, unions, intersections\n   167→  - `class` when behavior (methods), internal state, or inheritance is required\n   168→  - **BECAUSE:** Choosing the right construct signals intent and makes the code self-documenting.\n   169→\n   170→- **RULE:** Avoid \"Primitive Obsession.\" Use specific types instead of raw primitives\n   171→  (`string`, `number`, `boolean`) to represent domain concepts.\n   172→  - **EXAMPLE:** Use `type UserId = string` or `type Currency = 'USD' | 'EUR' | 'GBP'`\n   173→    instead of bare strings.\n   174→  - **BECAUSE:** Domain-specific types improve type safety, self-documentation, and\n   175→    centralize validation logic.\n   176→\n   177→- **RULE:** Groups of primitives that are always used together SHOULD be encapsulated in\n   178→  an interface or type.\n   179→  - **BECAUSE:** Improves cohesion and makes the relationship explicit.\n   180→\n   181→- **RULE:** Use type assertions (`as any`, `as unknown as Type`) sparingly, with\n   182→  justification. Fix underlying type mismatches instead.\n   183→  - **BECAUSE:** Type assertions bypass safety and can hide bugs.\n   184→\n   185→- **RULE:** Never pepper code with literal constants. Use manifest constants defined at the\n   186→  top of the file (or in a constants module) for any numeric or string value that has meaning.\n   187→  - **BECAUSE:** Magic numbers and strings are cryptic, error-prone, and hard to update.\n   188→  - **BECAUSE:** Constants with descriptive names make code self-documenting.\n   189→\n   190→## 5. Coupling and Cohesion\n   191→\n   192→- **RULE:** Classes MUST have a single, well-defined responsibility (Single Responsibility\n   193→  Principle / SRP). Each class should have one reason to change.\n   194→  - **BECAUSE:** High cohesion makes classes easier to understand, test, and maintain.\n   195→\n   196→- **RULE:** Methods MUST perform a single logical operation.\n   197→  - **BECAUSE:** Single-purpose methods are more readable and testable.\n   198→\n   199→- **RULE:** Minimize coupling between modules. Depend on interfaces rather than concrete\n   200→  implementations, especially across module boundaries.\n   201→  - **BECAUSE:** Loose coupling makes the system more flexible and resilient to change.\n   202→\n   203→- **RULE:** Do not access private members of other classes. Interact through the public API.\n   204→  - **BECAUSE:** Violating encapsulation creates tight coupling that breaks when internals change.\n   205→\n   206→- **RULE:** Avoid \"Feature Envy.\" If a method mostly operates on another class's data,\n   207→  move it to that class.\n   208→  - **BECAUSE:** Improves cohesion and reduces coupling.\n   209→\n   210→- **RULE:** Utility functions used by only one class SHOULD be private to that class or\n   211→  its module, not exported globally.\n   212→  - **BECAUSE:** Keeps related logic together and avoids polluting the module scope.\n   213→\n   214→## 6. Error Handling\n   215→\n   216→- **RULE:** Avoid empty `catch` blocks. Always log the error or re-throw appropriately.\n   217→  - **BECAUSE:** Empty catches silently swallow errors, hiding problems that compound over time.\n   218→\n   219→- **RULE:** Do not use exceptions for normal control flow. Use conditional logic instead.\n   220→  - **BECAUSE:** Misusing exceptions is inefficient and obscures the actual logic.\n   221→\n   222→- **RULE:** Provide clear, informative error messages that include context (what was being\n   223→  attempted, what values were involved).\n   224→  - **BECAUSE:** Good error messages cut debugging time from hours to minutes.\n   225→\n   226→- **RULE:** When logging, always include variable names alongside values:\n   227→  `log(\"Failed to process order: orderId=${orderId}, status=${status}\")`\n   228→  - **BECAUSE:** Knowing which variable holds which value makes trace logs dramatically\n   229→    easier to read.\n   230→\n   231→- **RULE:** When troubleshooting unexpected values, consider whether the variable name is\n   232→  misleading. Rename for clarity if so.\n   233→  - **BECAUSE:** Clear naming aids debugging by making intent explicit.\n   234→\n   235→## 7. Comments and Documentation\n   236→\n   237→- **RULE:** Every exported function, interface, type, class, and global variable MUST have\n   238→  a doc comment (JSDoc, docstring, etc.) explaining its purpose.\n   239→  - **BECAUSE:** Documentation alongside the code improves understanding and maintainability.\n   240→\n   241→- **RULE:** Write comments to explain _why_, not _what_. The code should explain the what.\n   242→  Focus on rationale, business rules, workarounds, and non-obvious decisions.\n   243→  - **BECAUSE:** The \"why\" is context that code alone cannot convey.\n   244→\n   245→- **RULE:** Remove commented-out code. That's what version control is for.\n   246→  - **BECAUSE:** Commented code is noise that becomes outdated and confusing.\n   247→\n   248→- **RULE:** Ensure comments are accurate and up-to-date. Fix or remove misleading ones.\n   249→  - **BECAUSE:** An incorrect comment is worse than no comment.\n   250→\n   251→- **RULE:** Avoid excessive comments. If you feel the need to comment heavily, refactor\n   252→  the code for clarity instead (better naming, smaller functions, clearer structure).\n   253→  - **BECAUSE:** Self-documenting code is preferred. Comments that restate the obvious add\n   254→    clutter.\n   255→\n   256→- **RULE:** Remove development-phase comments (TODO, FIXME, attribution) before task\n   257→  completion. Use task trackers and commit messages instead.\n   258→  - **BECAUSE:** Stale TODOs accumulate as noise. The orchestrator's YAML plan is the\n   259→    proper place to track remaining work.\n   260→\n   261→## 8. Conditional Logic\n   262→\n   263→- **RULE:** Avoid large `switch` statements or long `if/else if/else` chains.\n   264→  - **BECAUSE:** Hard to read, maintain, and extend. Often violates the Open-Closed Principle.\n   265→\n   266→- **RULE:** Consider polymorphism (via interfaces) or lookup maps/objects instead of\n   267→  complex conditionals.\n   268→  - **BECAUSE:** Leads to cleaner, more extensible, and testable designs.\n   269→\n   270→## 9. UI Feedback Patterns\n   271→\n   272→- **RULE:** Before implementing success/error notifications in a component, check for\n   273→  existing toast, notification, or alert components in the project's UI library.\n   274→  - **BECAUSE:** Reusing the existing notification system ensures visual consistency and UX\n   275→    quality.\n   276→  - **BECAUSE:** Inline state-based message divs (`{error && <div>...</div>}`) create\n   277→    visual inconsistency, shift content, and require manual cleanup (setTimeout, etc.).\n   278→\n   279→- **RULE:** Use the project's established notification system for all user feedback. Do not\n   280→  add inline success/error state variables for displaying feedback messages.\n   281→  - **BECAUSE:** A centralized notification system handles auto-dismiss, positioning, and\n   282→    styling consistently.\n   283→\n   284→## 10. Build and Dev Server Management\n   285→\n   286→- **RULE:** After code changes, do not assume hot module replacement (HMR) will pick them up.\n   287→  When in doubt, restart the dev server.\n   288→  - **BECAUSE:** HMR is unreliable for many change types (new imports, structural changes,\n   289→    hook changes). A restart takes seconds and guarantees a clean state.\n   290→\n   291→- **RULE:** When the dev server shows manifest or module errors, restart the server first\n   292→  before attempting cache cleanup.\n   293→  - **BECAUSE:** A restart solves the vast majority of these issues instantly.\n   294→\n   295→- **RULE:** Always stop the dev server before running a production build. Dev caches and\n   296→  build caches can conflict.\n   297→  - **BECAUSE:** Cache conflicts produce mysterious errors that waste debugging time.\n   298→\n   299→- **RULE:** Never use `--no-lint` when building new code. It hides errors.\n   300→  - **BECAUSE:** Lint errors often indicate real problems. Suppressing them creates\n   301→    technical debt.\n   302→\n   303→## 11. Test Discipline\n   304→\n   305→- **RULE:** After ANY code change, run the related tests before moving on.\n   306→  - **BECAUSE:** Catching regressions immediately is orders of magnitude cheaper than\n   307→    finding them later.\n   308→\n   309→- **RULE:** Failing tests are YOUR responsibility. Fix them immediately --- do not defer or\n   310→  assume they were \"already broken.\"\n   311→  - **BECAUSE:** In an AI-orchestrated workflow, you are the sole developer. All failures\n   312→    result from your changes. Leaving them creates compounding tech debt.\n   313→\n   314→- **RULE:** TypeScript errors in test files count as broken tests.\n   315→  - **BECAUSE:** If it doesn't compile, it doesn't test.\n   316→\n   317→- **RULE:** When splitting large test suites, migrate incrementally: move one test group\n   318→  at a time, verify it passes, then continue.\n   319→  - **BECAUSE:** Incremental migration minimizes risk and ensures continuous validity.\n   320→\n   321→## 12. AI-Specific Discipline\n   322→\n   323→These rules address failure modes specific to AI code generation.\n   324→\n   325→- **RULE:** Never remove existing functionality when asked to \"clean up\" or \"simplify.\"\n   326→  Ask before removing any feature, field, or calculation.\n   327→  - **BECAUSE:** AIs sometimes interpret \"simplify\" as \"delete.\" Working features are never\n   328→    clutter.\n   329→\n   330→- **RULE:** Do not add features, refactor code, or make \"improvements\" beyond what was asked.\n   331→  A bug fix doesn't need surrounding code cleaned up. A simple feature doesn't need extra\n   332→  configurability.\n   333→  - **BECAUSE:** Over-engineering is a common AI failure mode. Each unnecessary addition\n   334→    introduces risk and costs tokens.\n   335→\n   336→- **RULE:** When a value is NULL or missing, show that state honestly (0, empty,\n   337→  \"Not configured\"). Do not invent fallback logic to show data from unrelated sources.\n   338→  - **BECAUSE:** Invented fallbacks mask real problems and confuse users who expect to see\n   339→    actual state.\n   340→\n   341→- **RULE:** Never use \"file is too large\" as an excuse to defer work. If a file is too large,\n   342→  split it into smaller modules and integrate them immediately.\n   343→  - **BECAUSE:** \"Deferred\" is not a valid status. Work is either done or needs to be done now.\n   344→\n   345→- **RULE:** Commit frequently. Uncommitted work is lost when the session ends.\n   346→  - **BECAUSE:** In an orchestrated workflow, each task runs in a fresh session. If the task\n   347→    doesn't commit, the work vanishes.\n   348→\n   349→---\n   350→\n   351→## Adapting These Rules\n   352→\n   353→This document is a template. To adapt it for your project:\n   354→\n   355→1. **Add project-specific paths** - Replace generic directory examples with your actual\n   356→   layout (e.g., `src/components/` for React, `app/models/` for Rails)\n   357→2. **Add framework rules** - Add sections for your framework (e.g., React hooks rules,\n   358→   Django model conventions, API design standards)\n   359→3. **Add a definitions registry** - Consider maintaining a `definitions.md` that maps each\n   360→   class/interface/type to its canonical file path and design document\n   361→4. **Add your build commands** - Replace generic \"run the build\" with your actual commands\n   362→   (e.g., `pnpm run build`, `cargo build`, `go build ./...`)\n   363→5. **Reference from SKILL.md** - The implement skill's Step 3 says \"Read the project's\n   364→   coding rules.\" Point it at this file.\n   365→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"8b88d385-ef10-40b6-80e4-368ad29d57f5","uuid":"1e78fa1d-dd57-4481-bf14-4557d66db51d","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/Users/martinbechard/dev/claude-plan-orchestrator/CODING-RULES.md","content":"# Coding Rules\n\nStandard rules and best practices for AI-generated code. These rules apply to any project\nusing the plan orchestrator. Adapt the examples to your language and framework.\n\nEach rule explains **why** it exists (the BECAUSE chain), so the AI can make correct\njudgment calls when the letter of the rule doesn't quite fit the situation.\n\n---\n\n## 0. File Headers and Design Traceability\n\n- **RULE:** Every source file MUST include a header comment with:\n  - File path (relative to project root)\n  - One-line summary of the file's purpose\n  - Reference to the design document that defines its behavior (if one exists)\n  - **BECAUSE:** Headers create an explicit link between implementation and specification,\n    preventing architectural drift.\n  - **BECAUSE:** When an AI agent picks up a task in a fresh session, the header tells it\n    where to find the design context without searching.\n\n- **RULE:** Before modifying existing code, ALWAYS verify changes against the design document\n  referenced in the header. If there is a discrepancy, raise the issue rather than silently\n  diverging.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Ensures implementation continues to align with the agreed-upon specification.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Catches unintended deviations early, before they cascade.\n\n- **RULE:** Major design changes or significant refactorings MUST be discussed and approved\n  before implementation.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Prevents costly rework if changes are later deemed undesirable.\n  - **BECAUSE:** In an orchestrated plan, one agent's unauthorized design change can break\n    assumptions held by subsequent tasks.\n\n- **RULE:** Design documents are the single source of truth for module behavior. When changing\n  code, the corresponding design doc MUST be updated to reflect the changes. Conversely, when\n  code seems incorrect, consult the design doc to understand the intended behavior.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Synchronized design and code reduces confusion and prevents drift.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Design documents provide essential context for recovering intended behavior.\n\n- **RULE:** After implementing changes and ensuring tests pass, ALWAYS perform a code review\n  (manual or automated) against the project's standards.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Code reviews catch issues that tests cannot: readability, maintainability,\n    adherence to conventions, and subtle logic errors.\n\n## 1. Naming Conventions\n\n- **RULE:** Follow your language's community conventions consistently:\n  - **PascalCase** for classes, interfaces, type definitions, React components\n  - **camelCase** for variables, functions, methods, utility files\n  - **ALL_CAPS_SNAKE_CASE** for manifest constants (values that never change at runtime)\n  - **kebab-case** for configuration files and non-code assets\n  - **BECAUSE:** Predictable naming reduces cognitive load. You can tell a file's purpose\n    from its casing alone.\n\n- **RULE:** File names containing a single primary class or component MUST be named to match\n  that class (e.g., `StatusManager.ts` for class `StatusManager`).\n  - **BECAUSE:** Creates a predictable mapping between the artifact and the filesystem,\n    reducing time spent searching for definitions.\n\n- **RULE:** Variable, function, and method names MUST be clear, descriptive, and reflect their\n  purpose. Avoid cryptic abbreviations or overly generic names (e.g., `data`, `manager`, `temp`).\n  - **BECAUSE:** The name itself should convey intent and nature, reducing the need for\n    comments and preventing ambiguity.\n\n- **RULE:** Function/method names SHOULD indicate their purpose through word choice:\n  - **Nouns/noun phrases** for functions that retrieve without side effects:\n    `orderCount`, `getUserProfile`, `isActive`\n  - **Verbs/verb phrases** for functions that alter state or perform actions:\n    `updateStatus`, `calculateTotal`, `saveConfiguration`\n  - **BECAUSE:** Signals to the reader whether calling the function might change system state.\n    This is the Command-Query Separation principle.\n\n- **RULE:** Avoid variable names that are easily confused (e.g., `orderCount` vs `orderCounts`\n  for different concepts). Be precise.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Subtle naming differences for distinct concepts lead to hard-to-find bugs.\n\n- **RULE:** Naming conventions MUST be applied consistently across the entire codebase.\n  - **BECAUSE:** A uniform style makes the codebase feel cohesive and easier to navigate.\n\n## 2. File Organization and Imports\n\n- **RULE:** Organize files into standard top-level directories based on their category:\n  - `src/` - All primary source code\n  - `scripts/` - Utility scripts for build, deployment, development tasks\n  - `docs/` - Documentation, design documents, plans\n  - `test/` or `tests/` - Test code, mocks, fixtures\n  - **BECAUSE:** Establishes a conventional structure that makes it easy to locate artifacts\n    and clearly separates source from supporting files.\n\n- **RULE:** Separate shared contracts from implementation:\n  - Shared interfaces/types/constants should live in dedicated directories\n    (e.g., `src/interfaces/`, `src/types/`, `src/constants/`)\n  - Items used only within a single module may remain co-located in that module\n  - **BECAUSE:** Centralizing shared contracts improves discoverability and prevents\n    scattering definitions across modules.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Clearly separates public API contracts from internal implementation details.\n\n- **RULE:** Any single source file exceeding 200 lines SHOULD be refactored into a module\n  folder with an entry point (`index.ts`, `__init__.py`, etc.) that exports only the\n  public API.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Prevents excessively long files that are hard to read, understand, and maintain.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Enforces a clear public API for each component.\n\n- **RULE:** Module entry points (e.g., `index.ts`) MUST only contain import/export statements.\n  No implementation logic.\n  - **BECAUSE:** The entry point defines the public contract. Mixing in logic blurs the boundary.\n\n- **RULE:** Each exported class SHOULD reside in its own distinct file.\n  - **BECAUSE:** One file, one purpose. Makes code review and maintenance simpler.\n\n- **RULE:** Test files MUST mirror the source directory structure.\n  - **EXAMPLE:** Tests for `src/services/workflow/Executor.ts` go in\n    `test/services/workflow/Executor.test.ts`.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Clear, predictable relationship between code and its tests.\n\n- **RULE:** Before creating a new file for a type, interface, or class, check whether a\n  suitable definition already exists. If it does, import it. If it does not, create it in\n  the correct location and register it in whatever central registry the project uses.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Prevents duplication and ensures a single source of truth for definitions.\n\n- **RULE:** Organize imports logically: external libraries first, then project-level aliases,\n  then relative imports. Remove all unused imports.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Consistent organization improves readability and makes dependencies clearer.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Unused imports clutter code and can cause confusion during refactoring.\n\n- **RULE:** Actively avoid and resolve circular dependencies between modules.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Circular dependencies cause runtime errors, make code harder to test,\n    and hinder modularity. Separating contracts into shared directories can break cycles.\n\n## 3. Code Structure and Readability\n\n- **RULE:** Methods SHOULD NOT exceed 30-40 lines. Extract complex logic into helper methods.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Shorter methods are easier to understand, test, and maintain. They tend to\n    have a single responsibility.\n\n- **RULE:** Classes SHOULD NOT exceed 300 lines. If a class grows beyond this, refactor into\n  a module folder.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Large classes often violate the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and\n    are hard to manage.\n\n- **RULE:** Functions accepting more than two parameters MUST use a parameter object.\n  Name the type descriptively (e.g., `CreateUserParams`, `SearchOptions`).\n  - **BECAUSE:** Parameter objects improve readability and maintainability, especially when\n    adding or removing parameters.\n\n- **RULE:** Prioritize code clarity and correctness over premature abstraction. Apply\n  abstractions when patterns are clear, not speculatively.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Maintainability and understandability come first. Three similar lines are\n    better than a premature abstraction that nobody understands.\n\n- **RULE:** Focus on minimal, necessary changes to achieve the goal. Avoid over-engineering.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Simpler solutions are easier to understand, test, and maintain.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Minimizing scope reduces the risk of unintended side effects.\n  - **BECAUSE:** In orchestrated plans, each task should do one thing well. Gold-plating\n    delays the plan and introduces risk.\n\n## 4. Types and Type Safety\n\n- **RULE:** Never use `any` as a type. Always create proper types for groups of fields.\n  TypeScript is all about types; using `any` defeats the purpose.\n  - **BECAUSE:** `any` bypasses all type checking, hiding bugs that the compiler would\n    otherwise catch.\n\n- **RULE:** Use the correct construct for the purpose:\n  - `interface` for contracts that classes can implement or objects must adhere to\n  - `type` for data shapes, function signatures, unions, intersections\n  - `class` when behavior (methods), internal state, or inheritance is required\n  - **BECAUSE:** Choosing the right construct signals intent and makes the code self-documenting.\n\n- **RULE:** Avoid \"Primitive Obsession.\" Use specific types instead of raw primitives\n  (`string`, `number`, `boolean`) to represent domain concepts.\n  - **EXAMPLE:** Use `type UserId = string` or `type Currency = 'USD' | 'EUR' | 'GBP'`\n    instead of bare strings.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Domain-specific types improve type safety, self-documentation, and\n    centralize validation logic.\n\n- **RULE:** Groups of primitives that are always used together SHOULD be encapsulated in\n  an interface or type.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Improves cohesion and makes the relationship explicit.\n\n- **RULE:** Use type assertions (`as any`, `as unknown as Type`) sparingly, with\n  justification. Fix underlying type mismatches instead.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Type assertions bypass safety and can hide bugs.\n\n- **RULE:** Never pepper code with literal constants. Use manifest constants defined at the\n  top of the file (or in a constants module) for any numeric or string value that has meaning.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Magic numbers and strings are cryptic, error-prone, and hard to update.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Constants with descriptive names make code self-documenting.\n\n## 5. Coupling and Cohesion\n\n- **RULE:** Classes MUST have a single, well-defined responsibility (Single Responsibility\n  Principle / SRP). Each class should have one reason to change.\n  - **BECAUSE:** High cohesion makes classes easier to understand, test, and maintain.\n\n- **RULE:** Methods MUST perform a single logical operation.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Single-purpose methods are more readable and testable.\n\n- **RULE:** Minimize coupling between modules. Depend on interfaces rather than concrete\n  implementations, especially across module boundaries.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Loose coupling makes the system more flexible and resilient to change.\n\n- **RULE:** Do not access private members of other classes. Interact through the public API.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Violating encapsulation creates tight coupling that breaks when internals change.\n\n- **RULE:** Avoid \"Feature Envy.\" If a method mostly operates on another class's data,\n  move it to that class.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Improves cohesion and reduces coupling.\n\n- **RULE:** Utility functions used by only one class SHOULD be private to that class or\n  its module, not exported globally.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Keeps related logic together and avoids polluting the module scope.\n\n## 6. Error Handling\n\n- **RULE:** Avoid empty `catch` blocks. Always log the error or re-throw appropriately.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Empty catches silently swallow errors, hiding problems that compound over time.\n\n- **RULE:** Do not use exceptions for normal control flow. Use conditional logic instead.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Misusing exceptions is inefficient and obscures the actual logic.\n\n- **RULE:** Provide clear, informative error messages that include context (what was being\n  attempted, what values were involved).\n  - **BECAUSE:** Good error messages cut debugging time from hours to minutes.\n\n- **RULE:** When logging, always include variable names alongside values:\n  `log(\"Failed to process order: orderId=${orderId}, status=${status}\")`\n  - **BECAUSE:** Knowing which variable holds which value makes trace logs dramatically\n    easier to read.\n\n- **RULE:** When troubleshooting unexpected values, consider whether the variable name is\n  misleading. Rename for clarity if so.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Clear naming aids debugging by making intent explicit.\n\n## 7. Comments and Documentation\n\n- **RULE:** Every exported function, interface, type, class, and global variable MUST have\n  a doc comment (JSDoc, docstring, etc.) explaining its purpose.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Documentation alongside the code improves understanding and maintainability.\n\n- **RULE:** Write comments to explain _why_, not _what_. The code should explain the what.\n  Focus on rationale, business rules, workarounds, and non-obvious decisions.\n  - **BECAUSE:** The \"why\" is context that code alone cannot convey.\n\n- **RULE:** Remove commented-out code. That's what version control is for.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Commented code is noise that becomes outdated and confusing.\n\n- **RULE:** Ensure comments are accurate and up-to-date. Fix or remove misleading ones.\n  - **BECAUSE:** An incorrect comment is worse than no comment.\n\n- **RULE:** Avoid excessive comments. If you feel the need to comment heavily, refactor\n  the code for clarity instead (better naming, smaller functions, clearer structure).\n  - **BECAUSE:** Self-documenting code is preferred. Comments that restate the obvious add\n    clutter.\n\n- **RULE:** Remove development-phase comments (TODO, FIXME, attribution) before task\n  completion. Use task trackers and commit messages instead.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Stale TODOs accumulate as noise. The orchestrator's YAML plan is the\n    proper place to track remaining work.\n\n## 8. Conditional Logic\n\n- **RULE:** Avoid large `switch` statements or long `if/else if/else` chains.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Hard to read, maintain, and extend. Often violates the Open-Closed Principle.\n\n- **RULE:** Consider polymorphism (via interfaces) or lookup maps/objects instead of\n  complex conditionals.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Leads to cleaner, more extensible, and testable designs.\n\n## 9. UI Feedback Patterns\n\n- **RULE:** Before implementing success/error notifications in a component, check for\n  existing toast, notification, or alert components in the project's UI library.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Reusing the existing notification system ensures visual consistency and UX\n    quality.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Inline state-based message divs (`{error && <div>...</div>}`) create\n    visual inconsistency, shift content, and require manual cleanup (setTimeout, etc.).\n\n- **RULE:** Use the project's established notification system for all user feedback. Do not\n  add inline success/error state variables for displaying feedback messages.\n  - **BECAUSE:** A centralized notification system handles auto-dismiss, positioning, and\n    styling consistently.\n\n## 10. Build and Dev Server Management\n\n- **RULE:** After code changes, do not assume hot module replacement (HMR) will pick them up.\n  When in doubt, restart the dev server.\n  - **BECAUSE:** HMR is unreliable for many change types (new imports, structural changes,\n    hook changes). A restart takes seconds and guarantees a clean state.\n\n- **RULE:** When the dev server shows manifest or module errors, restart the server first\n  before attempting cache cleanup.\n  - **BECAUSE:** A restart solves the vast majority of these issues instantly.\n\n- **RULE:** Always stop the dev server before running a production build. Dev caches and\n  build caches can conflict.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Cache conflicts produce mysterious errors that waste debugging time.\n\n- **RULE:** Never use `--no-lint` when building new code. It hides errors.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Lint errors often indicate real problems. Suppressing them creates\n    technical debt.\n\n## 11. Test Discipline\n\n- **RULE:** After ANY code change, run the related tests before moving on.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Catching regressions immediately is orders of magnitude cheaper than\n    finding them later.\n\n- **RULE:** Failing tests are YOUR responsibility. Fix them immediately --- do not defer or\n  assume they were \"already broken.\"\n  - **BECAUSE:** In an AI-orchestrated workflow, you are the sole developer. All failures\n    result from your changes. Leaving them creates compounding tech debt.\n\n- **RULE:** TypeScript errors in test files count as broken tests.\n  - **BECAUSE:** If it doesn't compile, it doesn't test.\n\n- **RULE:** When splitting large test suites, migrate incrementally: move one test group\n  at a time, verify it passes, then continue.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Incremental migration minimizes risk and ensures continuous validity.\n\n## 12. AI-Specific Discipline\n\nThese rules address failure modes specific to AI code generation.\n\n- **RULE:** Never remove existing functionality when asked to \"clean up\" or \"simplify.\"\n  Ask before removing any feature, field, or calculation.\n  - **BECAUSE:** AIs sometimes interpret \"simplify\" as \"delete.\" Working features are never\n    clutter.\n\n- **RULE:** Do not add features, refactor code, or make \"improvements\" beyond what was asked.\n  A bug fix doesn't need surrounding code cleaned up. A simple feature doesn't need extra\n  configurability.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Over-engineering is a common AI failure mode. Each unnecessary addition\n    introduces risk and costs tokens.\n\n- **RULE:** When a value is NULL or missing, show that state honestly (0, empty,\n  \"Not configured\"). Do not invent fallback logic to show data from unrelated sources.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Invented fallbacks mask real problems and confuse users who expect to see\n    actual state.\n\n- **RULE:** Never use \"file is too large\" as an excuse to defer work. If a file is too large,\n  split it into smaller modules and integrate them immediately.\n  - **BECAUSE:** \"Deferred\" is not a valid status. Work is either done or needs to be done now.\n\n- **RULE:** Commit frequently. Uncommitted work is lost when the session ends.\n  - **BECAUSE:** In an orchestrated workflow, each task runs in a fresh session. If the task\n    doesn't commit, the work vanishes.\n\n---\n\n## Adapting These Rules\n\nThis document is a template. To adapt it for your project:\n\n1. **Add project-specific paths** - Replace generic directory examples with your actual\n   layout (e.g., `src/components/` for React, `app/models/` for Rails)\n2. **Add framework rules** - Add sections for your framework (e.g., React hooks rules,\n   Django model conventions, API design standards)\n3. **Add a definitions registry** - Consider maintaining a `definitions.md` that maps each\n   class/interface/type to its canonical file path and design document\n4. **Add your build commands** - Replace generic \"run the build\" with your actual commands\n   (e.g., `pnpm run build`, `cargo build`, `go build ./...`)\n5. **Reference from SKILL.md** - The implement skill's Step 3 says \"Read the project's\n   coding rules.\" Point it at this file.\n","numLines":365,"startLine":1,"totalLines":365}}}

Modify run_claude_task() to always use structured JSON output from the Claude CLI, parse the result event, and populate TaskUsage on every TaskResult. Add a PlanUsageTracker to accumulate per-task usage into section-level and plan-level totals. Write a usage-report.json alongside plan logs when the plan completes.

Currently the orchestrator only uses structured output in verbose mode (--output-format stream-json). In non-verbose mode it uses plain text, which discards usage data.\n    34→\n    35→**Non-verbose mode change:** Add --output-format json to the CLI command. After the process completes, parse the final stdout as JSON to extract the result object containing usage fields. The \"progress dots\" display remains unchanged because dots are driven by byte counts, not by parsing stdout content.\n    36→\n    37→**Verbose mode change:** Modify stream_json_output() to capture and return the result event data. Currently it parses the result event (line 1803) and prints cost/duration/turns, but discards the data. Change: pass a mutable dict into the function; when the result event arrives, store it there.

The user experience changes slightly: instead of raw text stdout, we get JSON. But since non-verbose mode already shows progress dots (not raw output), the display is unaffected. We parse the JSON after process completion.\n   176→\n   177→2. **Use total_cost_usd from CLI, never calculate cost from tokens.** The CLI cost calculation accounts for pricing tiers, model variants, and cache discounts. Recalculating would be fragile and duplicate logic.\n   178→\n   179→3. **PlanUsageTracker lives in plan-orchestrator.py, not a separate module.** The orchestrator is a single-file script by convention. Adding a class to it follows the existing pattern of TaskResult, CircuitBreaker, OutputCollector.\n   180→\n   181→4. **Usage report goes to .claude/plans/logs/ alongside task logs.** This is the natural home for execution artifacts. The report filename includes the plan name for easy identification.\n   182→\n   183→5. **stream_json_output() captures usage data via a shared mutable dict.** Rather than changing the function signature (which would break threading), we pass a dict that it populates with the result event data. This is thread-safe because only the stdout thread writes to it (single writer, reader waits for thread join).\n   184→\n   185→6. **Auto-pipeline reads the usage report file rather than parsing orchestrator stdout.** This is cleaner and avoids fragile stdout parsing.

Modify run_claude_task() to always use structured JSON output from the Claude CLI, parse the result event, and populate TaskUsage on every TaskResult. Add a PlanUsageTracker to accumulate per-task usage into section-level and plan-level totals. Write a usage-report.json alongside plan logs when the plan completes. Enhance per-task log files with usage data.\n\n**Tech Stack:** Python 3 (plan-orchestrator.py, auto-pipeline.py), JSON (CLI output parsing, usage report), YAML (plan files)\n\n---\n\n## Architecture Overview\n\n### TaskUsage Dataclass\n\nNew dataclass added alongside TaskResult in plan-orchestrator.py:\n\n    @dataclass\n    class TaskUsage:\n        input_tokens: int = 0\n        output_tokens: int = 0\n        cache_read_tokens: int = 0\n        cache_creation_tokens: int = 0\n        total_cost_usd: float = 0.0\n        num_turns: int = 0\n        duration_api_ms: int = 0\n\nTaskResult gets an optional field:\n\n    usage: Optional[TaskUsage] = None\n\n### CLI Output Capture Strategy\n\nThe Claude CLI provides full usage data in its JSON output. Currently the orchestrator only uses structured output in verbose mode (--output-format stream-json). In non-verbose mode it uses plain text, which discards usage data.\n\n**Non-verbose mode change:** Add --output-format json to the CLI command. After the process completes, parse the final stdout as JSON to extract the result object containing usage fields. The \"progress dots\" display remains unchanged because dots are driven by byte counts, not by parsing stdout content.\n\n**Verbose mode change:** Modify stream_json_output() to capture and return the result event data. Currently it parses the result event (line 1803) and prints cost/duration/turns, but discards the data. Change: pass a mutable dict into the function; when the result event arrives, store it there. After the thread joins, run_claude_task() reads the dict.\n\n**Both paths produce a TaskUsage** that is attached to the returned TaskResult.\n\n### Usage Extraction\n\nFrom the CLI result JSON:\n\n    input_tokens = result.get(\"usage\", {}).get(\"input_tokens\", 0)\n    output_tokens = result.get(\"usage\", {}).get(\"output_tokens\", 0)\n    cache_read_tokens = result.get(\"usage\", {}).get(\"cache_read_input_tokens\", 0)\n    cache_creation_tokens = result.get(\"usage\", {}).get(\"cache_creation_input_tokens\", 0)\n    total_cost_usd = result.get(\"total_cost_usd\", 0.0)\n    num_turns = result.get(\"num_turns\", 0)\n    duration_api_ms = result.get(\"duration_api_ms\", 0)\n\nThe total_cost_usd field is authoritative (not calculated from tokens).\n\n### Helper: parse_task_usage()\n\nA standalone function that takes a result dict and returns a TaskUsage:\n\n    def parse_task_usage(result_data: dict) -> TaskUsage:\n        usage = result_data.get(\"usage\", {})\n        return TaskUsage(\n            input_tokens=usage.get(\"input_tokens\", 0),\n            output_tokens=usage.get(\"output_tokens\", 0),\n            cache_read_tokens=usage.get(\"cache_read_input_tokens\", 0),\n            cache_creation_tokens=usage.get(\"cache_creation_input_tokens\", 0),\n            total_cost_usd=result_data.get(\"total_cost_usd\", 0.0),\n            num_turns=result_data.get(\"num_turns\", 0),\n            duration_api_ms=result_data.get(\"duration_api_ms\", 0),\n        )\n\n### PlanUsageTracker\n\nA class that accumulates usage across all tasks:\n\n    class PlanUsageTracker:\n        def __init__(self):\n            self.task_usages: dict[str, TaskUsage] = {}\n\n        def record(self, task_id: str, usage: TaskUsage) -> None\n        def get_section_usage(self, plan: dict, section_id: str) -> TaskUsage\n        def get_total_usage(self) -> TaskUsage\n        def get_cache_hit_rate(self) -> float\n        def format_summary_line(self, task_id: str) -> str\n        def format_final_summary(self, plan: dict) -> str\n\nCache hit rate: cache_read_tokens / (cache_read_tokens + input_tokens) when denominator > 0, else 0.\n\n### Summary Output\n\nAfter each task completes, print a usage summary line:\n\n    [Usage] Task 1.1: $0.0234 | 1,234 in / 567 out / 890 cached (72% cache hit) | Running: $0.0456\n\nAfter all tasks complete, print a final summary:\n\n    === Usage Summary ===\n    Total cost: $0.1234\n    Total tokens: 12,345 input / 5,678 output\n    Cache: 8,901 read / 2,345 created (72% hit rate)\n    API time: 45.6s across 12 turns\n    Per-section breakdown:\n      Phase 1: $0.0456 (3 tasks)\n      Phase 2: $0.0778 (2 tasks)\n\n### Usage Report File\n\nAfter plan completion, write .claude/plans/logs/{plan-name}-usage-report.json:\n\n    {\n      \"plan_name\": \"Token Usage Tracking\",\n      \"completed_at\": \"2026-02-13T15:30:00\",\n      \"total\": {\n        \"cost_usd\": 0.1234,\n        \"input_tokens\": 12345,\n        \"output_tokens\": 5678,\n        \"cache_read_tokens\": 8901,\n        \"cache_creation_tokens\": 2345,\n        \"cache_hit_rate\": 0.72,\n        \"num_turns\": 12,\n        \"duration_api_ms\": 45600\n      },\n      \"sections\": [\n        {\"id\": \"phase-1\", \"name\": \"Phase 1\", \"cost_usd\": 0.0456, \"task_count\": 3},\n        ...\n      ],\n      \"tasks\": [\n        {\"id\": \"1.1\", \"name\": \"Task name\", \"cost_usd\": 0.0123, ...},\n        ...\n      ]\n    }\n\n### Log File Enhancement\n\nThe existing per-task log files (.claude/plans/logs/task-*.log) get additional lines in the header:\n\n    === Claude Task Output ===\n    Timestamp: 2026-02-13T15:30:00\n    Duration: 45.6s\n    Return code: 0\n    Cost: $0.0123\n    Tokens: 1234 input / 567 output / 890 cache_read / 234 cache_create\n    Turns: 5\n    API time: 12345ms\n\n### Auto-Pipeline Integration\n\nThe auto-pipeline invokes the orchestrator as a child process. The usage report file is written by the orchestrator itself, so the auto-pipeline does not need to parse orchestrator stdout for usage data. Instead:\n\n1. After execute_plan() returns, read the usage report JSON if it exists\n2. Accumulate per-work-item totals (plan creation + orchestrator execution)\n3. At session end, write a session-level summary to .claude/plans/logs/pipeline-session-{timestamp}.json\n\n---\n\n## Key Files\n\n### Modified Files\n\n| File | Change |\n|------|--------|\n| scripts/plan-orchestrator.py | TaskUsage dataclass, parse CLI JSON output, PlanUsageTracker, usage report, log enhancement |\n| scripts/auto-pipeline.py | Read usage reports, aggregate per-session |\n\n### New Files\n\n| File | Purpose |\n|------|--------|\n| tests/test_token_usage.py | Unit tests for TaskUsage, PlanUsageTracker, usage parsing |\n| .claude/plans/logs/*-usage-report.json | Generated usage reports (not committed) |\n\n---\n\n## Design Decisions\n\n1. **Always use --output-format json in non-verbose mode.** This is the minimal change to get structured output. The user experience changes slightly: instead of raw text stdout, we get JSON. But since non-verbose mode already shows progress dots (not raw output), the display is unaffected. We parse the JSON after process completion.\n\n2. **Use total_cost_usd from CLI, never calculate cost from tokens.** The CLI cost calculation accounts for pricing tiers, model variants, and cache discounts. Recalculating would be fragile and duplicate logic.\n\n3. **PlanUsageTracker lives in plan-orchestrator.py, not a separate module.** The orchestrator is a single-file script by convention. Adding a class to it follows the existing pattern of TaskResult, CircuitBreaker, OutputCollector.\n\n4. **Usage report goes to .claude/plans/logs/ alongside task logs.** This is the natural home for execution artifacts. The report filename includes the plan name for easy identification.\n\n5. **stream_json_output() captures usage data via a shared mutable dict.** Rather than changing the function signature (which would break threading), we pass a dict that it populates with the result event data. This is thread-safe because only the stdout thread writes to it (single writer, reader waits for thread join).\n\n6. **Auto-pipeline reads the usage report file rather than parsing orchestrator stdout.** This is cleaner and avoids fragile stdout parsing. The orchestrator writes the report, the pipeline reads it.\n\n7. **Cache hit rate uses cache_read / (cache_read + input_tokens).** This measures what fraction of input context was served from cache vs. freshly processed. A higher rate means lower cost per token.\n\n8. **parse_task_usage() is a pure function.** Extracting a standalone helper makes it testable without mocking CLI processes. Both verbose and non-verbose paths call the same function.\n","numLines":190,"startLine":1,"totalLines":190}}}

Now let me compile the full findings report. Since I'm a **read-only code-reviewer agent**, I can verify all the static checks but cannot run the Bash-based execution checks. Let me document what I found through static analysis.\n\n`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`\nThis task is a verification phase using a code-reviewer agent. Code-reviewer agents are read-only by design — they inspect code through Glob, Grep, and Read tools only. The execution-based checks (syntax compilation, pytest, dry-run) need to be noted as requiring manual execution or a different agent type. However, all the static verification checks (existence of classes, grep counts, code patterns) can be done read-only.\n`─────────────────────────────────────────────────`\n\nHere's my complete findings report based on the read-only static analysis:\n\n---\n\n**VERDICT: PASS**\n\n**FINDINGS:**\n\n- [PASS] TaskUsage dataclass exists at `plan-orchestrator.py:307` with correct `@dataclass` decorator and all 7 fields (input_tokens, output_tokens, cache_read_tokens, cache_creation_tokens, total_cost_usd, num_turns, duration_api_ms) — matches design doc.\n\n- [PASS] parse_task_usage() function exists at `plan-orchestrator.py:330` with correct docstring, extracts all fields from the CLI result JSON using `.get()` with 0 defaults — matches design doc field names (`cache_read_input_tokens`, `cache_creation_input_tokens`).\n\n- [PASS] PlanUsageTracker class exists at `plan-orchestrator.py:352` with all 7 methods: `record()`, `get_section_usage()`, `get_total_usage()`, `get_cache_hit_rate()`, `format_summary_line()`, `format_final_summary()`, `write_report()` — matches design doc.\n\n- [PASS] TaskResult has `usage: Optional[TaskUsage] = None` field at `plan-orchestrator.py:327`.\n\n- [PASS] `--output-format json` is used in non-verbose mode at `plan-orchestrator.py:2035` and `--output-format stream-json` in verbose mode at `plan-orchestrator.py:2033` — 2 occurrences of `output-format` as expected.\n\n- [PASS] `Cost:` is written to log file headers at `plan-orchestrator.py:2161` along with Tokens, Turns, and API time (lines 2162-2167) — log header enhancement is present.\n\n- [PASS] `result_capture` dict pattern: created at line 2063, passed to `stream_json_output` at line 2069, populated via `result_capture.update(event)` at line 2008, and parsed to JSON in non-verbose mode at line 2142 — matches design doc's \"shared mutable dict\" approach.\n\n- [PASS] `usage=task_usage` is passed to all TaskResult constructors at lines 2190, 2198, 2219, 2228, 2237 and `usage=None` at lines 2246, 2254 for error paths — all return paths covered.\n\n- [PASS] `usage_tracker = PlanUsageTracker()` initialized in `run_orchestrator()` at line 2371, records usage in both parallel (line 2561) and sequential (line 2699) execution paths, prints final summary at line 2818, and writes report at line 2824.\n\n- [PASS] `SessionUsageTracker` class in `auto-pipeline.py:496` with `record_from_report()`, `format_session_summary()`, `write_session_report()` methods. Integrated into `main_loop()` at line 1448 with session summary printed at line 1548.\n\n- [PASS] `MAX_PLAN_NAME_LENGTH = 50` constant defined at `plan-orchestrator.py:48` and `auto-pipeline.py:493` — no magic numbers in filename truncation logic.\n\n- [PASS] Test file `tests/test_token_usage.py` has proper header with file path, purpose summary, and design doc reference (line 1-3). Contains 12 test cases covering TaskUsage defaults, parse_task_usage (full/empty/partial/missing-key), and PlanUsageTracker (record+total, cache-hit-rate, cache-hit-rate-zero, section-usage, format-summary-line, format-final-summary, write-report).\n\n- [PASS] File headers present on `plan-orchestrator.py` (lines 1-10) and `auto-pipeline.py` (lines 1-13) with file purpose and copyright.\n\n- [PASS] No `any` types used — all typed with `dict`, `str`, `int`, `float`, `Optional[TaskUsage]`, `list[dict]`, etc.\n\n- [PASS] No TODO/FIXME comments found in the new code.\n\n- [PASS] Naming conventions: PascalCase for classes (TaskUsage, PlanUsageTracker, SessionUsageTracker), snake_case for functions/methods (parse_task_usage, get_total_usage, format_summary_line), ALL_CAPS_SNAKE_CASE for constants (MAX_PLAN_NAME_LENGTH, TASK_LOG_DIR).\n\n**NOTE:** The following execution-based checks could not be performed by this read-only reviewer and should be run manually or by a validator agent:\n1. `python3 -c \"import py_compile; py_compile.compile(...)\"` — syntax compilation\n2. `python3 -m pytest tests/` — unit test execution  \n3. `python3 scripts/plan-orchestrator.py --plan .claude/plans/sample-plan.yaml --dry-run` — dry-run verification\n\n**EVIDENCE:**\n- Finding 1 (TaskUsage): `@dataclass` at line 306, class at line 307-315 with 7 fields matching design doc\n- Finding 2 (parse_task_usage): Function at line 330-349, maps CLI JSON fields correctly (`cache_read_input_tokens` → `cache_read_tokens`)\n- Finding 3 (PlanUsageTracker): Class at lines 352-500+, all methods present with proper docstrings\n- Finding 4 (output-format): Two grep matches at lines 2033 and 2035 confirming both verbose (`stream-json`) and non-verbose (`json`) modes\n- Finding 5 (Cost in logs): Grep match at line 2161 showing `f\"Cost: ${cost:.4f}\\n\"` in the log header block\n- Finding 6 (Tests): 12 test functions covering all public API of TaskUsage, parse_task_usage, and PlanUsageTracker\n\n---\n\nNow let me write the status file."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":126,"cache_read_input_tokens":69360,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":126},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"8b88d385-ef10-40b6-80e4-368ad29d57f5","uuid":"bfa1f321-89fa-484b-a66f-5e25ecb09f8a"}
