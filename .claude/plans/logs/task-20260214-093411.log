Read the backlog item file: {item_path}\n2. Read procedure-coding-rules.md for coding standards\n3. Read an existing YAML plan for format reference: look at .claude/plans/*.yaml files\n4. Read the CLAUDE.md file for project conventions\n5. If the backlog item has a ## Verification Log section, READ IT CAREFULLY.\n   Previous fix attempts and their verification results are recorded there.\n   Your plan MUST address any unresolved findings from prior verifications.\n\n## What to produce\n\n1. Create a design document at: docs/plans/{date}-{slug}-design.md\n   - Brief architecture overview\n   - Key files to create/modify\n   - Design decisions\n\n2. Create a YAML plan at: .claude/plans/{slug}.yaml\n   - Use the exact format: meta + sections with nested tasks\n   - Each section has: id, name, status: pending, tasks: [...]\n   - Each task has: id, name, description, status: pending\n   - Task descriptions should be detailed enough for a fresh Claude session to execute\n   - Include: documentation tasks, implementation tasks, unit tests, verification\n   - The verification task should run {build_command} and {test_command}\n\n3. Validate the plan: python scripts/plan-orchestrator.py --plan .claude/plans/{slug}.yaml --dry-run\n   - If validation fails, fix the YAML format and retry\n\n4. Git commit both files with message: \"plan: add {slug} design and YAML plan\"\n\n## Backlog item type: {item_type}\n\n## Agent Selection\n\nTasks can specify which agent should execute them via the optional \"agent\" field.\nAvailable agents are in {agents_dir}:\n\n- **coder**: Implementation specialist. Use for coding, implementation, and\n  modification tasks. This is the default if no agent is specified.\n- **code-reviewer**: Read-only reviewer. Use for verification, review, and\n  compliance-checking tasks.\n\nExample:\n  - id: '2.1'\n    name: Implement the feature\n    agent: coder\n    status: pending\n    description: ...\n\n  - id: '3.1'\n    name: Review code quality\n    agent: code-reviewer\n    status: pending\n    description: ...\n\nIf you do not set the agent field, the orchestrator will infer it from the\ntask description (verification tasks get code-reviewer, everything else gets coder).\n\n## Validation (Optional)\n\nPlans can enable per-task validation by adding a validation block to the meta section. When enabled, a validator agent runs after each coder task to independently verify the result.\n\nExample meta configuration:\n\n  meta:\n    validation:\n      enabled: true\n      run_after:\n        - coder\n      validators:\n        - validator\n      max_validation_attempts: 1\n\nThe validator produces PASS/WARN/FAIL verdicts:\n- PASS: task proceeds normally\n- WARN: task completes but warnings are logged\n- FAIL: task is retried with validation findings prepended to the prompt\n\nFor defect fixes, use the issue-verifier validator instead of or in addition to the default validator. This validator reads the original defect file and checks whether reported symptoms are resolved.\n\n## Important\n- Follow the CLAUDE.md change workflow order: docs -> code -> tests -> verification\n- For defects: include a task to verify the fix with a regression test\n- For features: include documentation, implementation, unit tests, and E2E tests as appropriate\n- Keep tasks focused - each task should be completable in one Claude session (under 10 minutes)\n- If the backlog item has a ## Verification Log with unresolved findings, your plan\n  must specifically address those findings. The previous code fix may be correct but\n  incomplete (e.g., operational steps not executed, data not deployed).\n\"\"\"\n\n\ndef reset_interrupted_tasks(plan_path: str) -> int:\n    \"\"\"Reset in_progress tasks back to pending and clear their attempt counters.\n\n    When the pipeline is killed mid-task, the orchestrator leaves tasks as\n    'in_progress'.

Your job is to check whether a defect's\nreported symptoms have been fully resolved. You must NOT fix anything. You only observe and report.\n\n## Instructions\n\n1. Read the defect file: {item_path}\n2. Read the \"Expected Behavior\" and \"Actual Behavior\" sections carefully\n3. Read the \"Fix Required\" section for any commands or checks that should be performed\n4. If there is a \"## Verification Log\" section, read previous verification attempts\n\n## What to check\n\nFor each item in \"Fix Required\" or \"Verification\" that describes a testable condition:\n- Run the command or check the condition\n- Record whether it passed or failed\n- Record the actual output or observation\n\nAlso check:\n- Does `{build_command}` pass? (code correctness)\n- Do unit tests pass? (`{test_command}`)\n- Is the reported symptom actually gone? (the MOST IMPORTANT check)\n\n## What to produce\n\nAppend your findings to the defect file at {item_path}.\nIf no \"## Verification Log\" section exists, create one at the end of the file.\n\nUse this exact format (the count MUST increment from the last entry, or start at 1):\n\n```\n### Verification #{count} -

be specific about command outputs)\n```\n\n## CRITICAL RULES\n\n- Do NOT modify any code files\n- Do NOT fix anything\n- Do NOT change the defect's ## Status line\n- ONLY read, run verification commands, and append findings to the defect file\n- If you need the dev server running for a check, start it with `{dev_server_command}`, wait for it,\n  run your check, then stop it\n- Git commit the updated defect file with message: \"verify: {slug} verification #{count}\"\n\"\"\"\n\n# Maximum number of verify-then-fix cycles before giving up\nMAX_VERIFICATION_CYCLES = 3\n\n\ndef count_verification_attempts(item_path: str) -> int:\n    \"\"\"Count how many verification entries exist in the defect file.\"\"\"\n    try:\n        with open(item_path, \"r\") as f:\n            content = f.read()\n    except IOError:\n        return 0\n\n    return len(re.findall(r\"### Verification #\\d+\", content))\n\n\ndef last_verification_passed(item_path: str) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"Check if the most recent verification entry has Verdict: PASS.\"\"\"\n    try:\n        with open(item_path, \"r\") as f:\n            content = f.read()\n    except IOError:\n        return False\n\n    # Find all verdict lines and check the last one\n    verdicts = re.findall(r\"\\*\\*Verdict:\\s*(PASS|FAIL)\\*\\*\", content, re.IGNORECASE)\n    if not verdicts:\n        return False\n    return verdicts[-1].upper() == \"PASS\"\n\n\ndef verify_item(item: BacklogItem, dry_run: bool = False) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"Run symptom verification on a completed defect fix.\n\n    Returns True if verification passed, False if it failed.\n    The verifier appends findings to the defect file regardless of outcome.\n    \"\"\"\n    if item.item_type != \"defect\":\n        # Features don't have symptom verification (yet)\n        return True\n\n    attempt_count = count_verification_attempts(item.path) + 1\n\n    if dry_run:\n        log(f\"[DRY RUN] Would verify symptoms for: {item.display_name} (attempt #{attempt_count})\")\n        return True\n\n    log(f\"Running symptom verification #{attempt_count}...\")\n\n    prompt = VERIFICATION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE.format(\n        item_path=item.path,\n        slug=item.slug,\n        count=attempt_count,\n        build_command=BUILD_COMMAND,\n        test_command=TEST_COMMAND,\n        dev_server_command=DEV_SERVER_COMMAND,\n    )\n\n    cmd = [*CLAUDE_CMD, \"--dangerously-skip-permissions\", \"--print\", prompt]\n\n    result = run_child_process(\n        cmd,\n        description=f\"Verify {item.slug} #{attempt_count}\",\n        timeout=PLAN_CREATION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS,\n        show_output=VERBOSE,\n    )\n\n    if result.rate_limited:\n        log(\"Rate limited during verification\")\n        return False\n\n    if not result.success:\n        log(f\"Verification process failed (exit {result.exit_code})\")\n        return False\n\n    # Check if the verifier recorded a PASS\n    passed = last_verification_passed(item.path)\n    if passed:\n        log(f\"Verification #{attempt_count}: PASSED\")\n    else:\n        log(f\"Verification #{attempt_count}: FAILED -

The user experience changes slightly: instead of raw text stdout, we get JSON. But since non-verbose mode already shows progress dots (not raw output), the display is unaffected. We parse the JSON after process completion.\n   176→\n   177→2. **Use total_cost_usd from CLI, never calculate cost from tokens.** The CLI cost calculation accounts for pricing tiers, model variants, and cache discounts. Recalculating would be fragile and duplicate logic.\n   178→\n   179→3. **PlanUsageTracker lives in plan-orchestrator.py, not a separate module.** The orchestrator is a single-file script by convention. Adding a class to it follows the existing pattern of TaskResult, CircuitBreaker, OutputCollector.\n   180→\n   181→4. **Usage report goes to .claude/plans/logs/ alongside task logs.** This is the natural home for execution artifacts. The report filename includes the plan name for easy identification.\n   182→\n   183→5. **stream_json_output() captures usage data via a shared mutable dict.** Rather than changing the function signature (which would break threading), we pass a dict that it populates with the result event data. This is thread-safe because only the stdout thread writes to it (single writer, reader waits for thread join).\n   184→\n   185→6. **Auto-pipeline reads the usage report file rather than parsing orchestrator stdout.** This is cleaner and avoids fragile stdout parsing. The orchestrator writes the report, the pipeline reads it.\n   186→\n   187→7. **Cache hit rate uses cache_read / (cache_read + input_tokens).** This measures what fraction of input context was served from cache vs. freshly processed. A higher rate means lower cost per token.\n   188→\n   189→8. **parse_task_usage() is a pure function.** Extracting a standalone helper makes it testable without mocking CLI processes. Both verbose and non-verbose paths call the same function.\n   190→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"a38c7583-3e6d-457c-b539-7ab7603d329a","uuid":"0b943f7a-3a54-455e-a9a0-d98b9fc34c43","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/Users/martinbechard/dev/claude-plan-orchestrator/docs/plans/2026-02-14-06-token-usage-tracking-design.md","content":"# Token Usage Tracking and Cost Reporting - Design Document\n\n**Goal:** Track token consumption across orchestrator tasks and auto-pipeline work items, producing per-task and aggregate usage reports.\n\n**Architecture:** Add a TaskUsage dataclass to hold per-task metrics (tokens, cost, cache stats).

The usage report file is written by the orchestrator itself, so the auto-pipeline does not need to parse orchestrator stdout for usage data. Instead:\n\n1. After execute_plan() returns, read the usage report JSON if it exists\n2. Accumulate per-work-item totals (plan creation + orchestrator execution)\n3. At session end, write a session-level summary to .claude/plans/logs/pipeline-session-{timestamp}.json\n\n---\n\n## Key Files\n\n### Modified Files\n\n| File | Change |\n|------|--------|\n| scripts/plan-orchestrator.py | TaskUsage dataclass, parse CLI JSON output, PlanUsageTracker, usage report, log enhancement |\n| scripts/auto-pipeline.py | Read usage reports, aggregate per-session |\n\n### New Files\n\n| File | Purpose |\n|------|--------|\n| tests/test_token_usage.py | Unit tests for TaskUsage, PlanUsageTracker, usage parsing |\n| .claude/plans/logs/*-usage-report.json | Generated usage reports (not committed) |\n\n---\n\n## Design Decisions\n\n1. **Always use --output-format json in non-verbose mode.** This is the minimal change to get structured output. The user experience changes slightly: instead of raw text stdout, we get JSON. But since non-verbose mode already shows progress dots (not raw output), the display is unaffected. We parse the JSON after process completion.\n\n2. **Use total_cost_usd from CLI, never calculate cost from tokens.** The CLI cost calculation accounts for pricing tiers, model variants, and cache discounts. Recalculating would be fragile and duplicate logic.\n\n3. **PlanUsageTracker lives in plan-orchestrator.py, not a separate module.** The orchestrator is a single-file script by convention. Adding a class to it follows the existing pattern of TaskResult, CircuitBreaker, OutputCollector.\n\n4. **Usage report goes to .claude/plans/logs/ alongside task logs.** This is the natural home for execution artifacts. The report filename includes the plan name for easy identification.\n\n5. **stream_json_output() captures usage data via a shared mutable dict.** Rather than changing the function signature (which would break threading), we pass a dict that it populates with the result event data. This is thread-safe because only the stdout thread writes to it (single writer, reader waits for thread join).\n\n6. **Auto-pipeline reads the usage report file rather than parsing orchestrator stdout.** This is cleaner and avoids fragile stdout parsing. The orchestrator writes the report, the pipeline reads it.\n\n7. **Cache hit rate uses cache_read / (cache_read + input_tokens).** This measures what fraction of input context was served from cache vs. freshly processed. A higher rate means lower cost per token.\n\n8. **parse_task_usage() is a pure function.** Extracting a standalone helper makes it testable without mocking CLI processes. Both verbose and non-verbose paths call the same function.\n","numLines":190,"startLine":1,"totalLines":190}}}
