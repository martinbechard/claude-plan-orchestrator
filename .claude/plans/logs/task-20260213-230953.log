The orchestrator only starts a task when all its dependencies are completed:\n   205→\n   206→```yaml\n   207→- id: '3.1'\n   208→  depends_on:\n   209→  - '2.1'\n   210→  - '2.2'\n   211→  - '2.3'\n   212→```\n   213→\n   214→### Circuit Breaker\n   215→\n   216→After 3 consecutive task failures (configurable), the orchestrator pauses for 300 seconds before retrying. This prevents burning through rate limits or repeatedly hitting the same error.\n   217→\n   218→### Rate Limit Detection\n   219→\n   220→When Claude CLI output contains rate limit messages (\"You've hit your limit\"), the orchestrator:\n   221→1. Parses the reset time from the message\n   222→2. Calculates wait duration with timezone awareness\n   223→3. Sleeps until reset + 30s buffer\n   224→4. Resumes execution automatically\n   225→\n   226→### Graceful Stop\n   227→\n   228→To stop the orchestrator between tasks without killing it:\n   229→\n   230→```bash\n   231→touch .claude/plans/.stop\n   232→```\n   233→\n   234→The orchestrator checks for this semaphore before each new task and exits cleanly. Remove it to allow future runs.\n   235→\n   236→### Post-Plan Smoke Tests\n   237→\n   238→After all tasks complete, the orchestrator can run Playwright smoke tests to verify the application still works:\n   239→\n   240→```bash\n   241→# Enabled by default (looks for tests/SMOKE01-critical-paths.spec.ts)\n   242→python scripts/plan-orchestrator.py --plan .claude/plans/my-feature.yaml\n   243→\n   244→# Disable smoke tests\n   245→python scripts/plan-orchestrator.py --plan .claude/plans/my-feature.yaml --skip-smoke\n   246→```\n   247→\n   248→### Plan Modification by Claude\n   249→\n   250→Claude can modify the YAML plan during execution:\n   251→- **Split tasks**: Large task 2.1 becomes 2.1a, 2.1b, 2.1c\n   252→- **Add tasks**: Insert discovered work\n   253→- **Skip tasks**: Mark unnecessary tasks as skipped\n   254→- **Self-extending plans**: A task can append new tasks and set `plan_modified: true`\n   255→\n   256→Set `plan_modified: true` in the status file to trigger a plan reload.\n   257→\n   258→### Verbose / Streaming Output\n   259→\n   260→Use `--verbose` for real-time streaming of Claude's output via `--output-format stream-json`:\n   261→\n   262→```bash\n   263→python scripts/plan-orchestrator.py --plan .claude/plans/my-feature.yaml --verbose\n   264→```\n   265→\n   266→## Auto-Pipeline\n   267→\n   268→The auto-pipeline daemon (`scripts/auto-pipeline.py`) watches backlog folders and drives the orchestrator automatically:\n   269→\n   270→```bash\n   271→# Watch backlogs and process items\n   272→python scripts/auto-pipeline.py\n   273→\n   274→# Single pass (process one item, then exit)\n   275→python scripts/auto-pipeline.py --once\n   276→\n   277→# Dry run\n   278→python scripts/auto-pipeline.py --dry-run\n   279→\n   280→# Verbose output\n   281→python scripts/auto-pipeline.py --verbose\n   282→```\n   283→\n   284→The auto-pipeline:\n   285→1. Monitors `docs/defect-backlog/` and `docs/feature-backlog/` for new `.md` files\n   286→2. Prioritizes defects over features; respects `## Dependencies` between items\n   287→3. For each item: Claude creates a design + YAML plan, then the orchestrator executes it\n   288→4. For defects: runs an independent verification step to confirm symptoms are resolved\n   289→5. If verification fails: deletes stale plan, retries with findings (up to 3 cycles)\n   290→6. Archives completed items to `completed/` subdirectories\n   291→7.

Context accumulates, quality drops, and implementation details get contradicted after 3-4 tasks. The orchestrator solves this by giving each task a fresh Claude session with:\n- Clean context focused on ONE task\n- The full plan available for reference\n- Automatic status tracking and commits\n\nSee [docs/narrative/](docs/narrative/) for the full development history and design rationale.\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Python 3.8+\n- PyYAML (`pip install pyyaml`)\n- Claude Code CLI installed and authenticated\n- Git (for version control and parallel worktrees)\n- Optional: `watchdog` (`pip install watchdog`) for auto-pipeline\n\n## Installation\n\nCopy the orchestrator components to your project:\n\n```bash\n# Clone this repo\ngit clone https://github.com/martinbechard/claude-plan-orchestrator.git\n\n# Copy to your project\ncp -r claude-plan-orchestrator/.claude/ /path/to/your/project/\ncp -r claude-plan-orchestrator/scripts/ /path/to/your/project/\ncp -r claude-plan-orchestrator/docs/ /path/to/your/project/\n```\n\nOr copy individual files:\n\n```bash\n# Required\ncp scripts/plan-orchestrator.py /your/project/scripts/\n\n# Recommended\ncp CODING-RULES.md /your/project/                  # Coding standards template\ncp .claude/skills/implement/SKILL.md /your/project/.claude/skills/implement/\n\n# Optional\ncp scripts/auto-pipeline.py /your/project/scripts/\ncp .claude/commands/implement.md /your/project/.claude/commands/\ncp .claude/plans/sample-plan.yaml /your/project/.claude/plans/\n```\n\n## Quick Start\n\n### 1. Create your plan\n\n```bash\ncp .claude/plans/sample-plan.yaml .claude/plans/my-feature.yaml\n```\n\nEdit the plan with your tasks:\n\n```yaml\nmeta:\n  name: My Feature\n  description: What this plan accomplishes\n  plan_doc: docs/plans/2026-01-20-my-feature-design.md\n  created: '2026-01-20'\n  max_attempts_default: 3\n\nsections:\n- id: phase-1\n  name: Phase 1 - Setup\n  status: pending\n  tasks:\n  - id: '1.1'\n    name: Create initial structure\n    status: pending\n    description: Set up the basic project structure\n  - id: '1.2'\n    name: Add configuration\n    status: pending\n    description: Add configuration files\n    depends_on:\n    - '1.1'\n\n- id: phase-2\n  name: Phase 2 - Implementation (Parallel)\n  status: pending\n  tasks:\n  - id: '2.1'\n    name: Build component A\n    status: pending\n    description: Implement component A\n    parallel_group: phase-2-impl\n    depends_on:\n    - '1.2'\n  - id: '2.2'\n    name: Build component B\n    status: pending\n    description: Implement component B\n    parallel_group: phase-2-impl\n    depends_on:\n    - '1.2'\n```\n\n### 2. Create your design document\n\nWrite detailed implementation steps at `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-my-feature-design.md`. The more detailed, the better Claude will execute each task.\n\n### 3. Run the orchestrator\n\n```bash\n# Dry run first (shows what would execute)\npython scripts/plan-orchestrator.py --plan .claude/plans/my-feature.yaml --dry-run\n\n# Run all pending tasks\npython scripts/plan-orchestrator.py --plan .claude/plans/my-feature.yaml\n\n# Run with parallel execution\npython scripts/plan-orchestrator.py --plan .claude/plans/my-feature.yaml --parallel\n\n# Run single task then stop\npython scripts/plan-orchestrator.py --plan .claude/plans/my-feature.yaml --single-task\n\n# Resume from specific task\npython scripts/plan-orchestrator.py --plan .claude/plans/my-feature.yaml --resume-from 2.1\n\n# Verbose output with real-time streaming\npython scripts/plan-orchestrator.py --plan .claude/plans/my-feature.yaml --verbose\n\n# Skip post-plan smoke tests\npython scripts/plan-orchestrator.py --plan .claude/plans/my-feature.yaml --skip-smoke\n```\n\n## Features\n\n### Parallel Execution\n\nTasks with the same `parallel_group` run concurrently in isolated git worktrees:\n\n```yaml\n- id: '2.1'\n  parallel_group: phase-2-impl    # Same group = run in parallel\n  depends_on: ['1.2']\n- id: '2.2'\n  parallel_group: phase-2-impl    # Same group = run in parallel\n  depends_on: ['1.2']\n- id: '2.3'\n  exclusive_resources: [database]  # Can't share = run sequentially\n  depends_on: ['1.2']\n```\n\nEach parallel task:\n- Runs in its own git worktree (isolated working directory)\n- Follows a subagent coordination protocol (file claims, heartbeats)\n- Has artifacts merged back via file-copy (not git merge, to avoid YAML conflicts)\n\n### Dependency Management\n\nTasks declare dependencies with `depends_on`. The orchestrator only starts a task when all its dependencies are completed:\n\n```yaml\n- id: '3.1'\n  depends_on:\n  - '2.1'\n  - '2.2'\n  - '2.3'\n```\n\n### Circuit Breaker\n\nAfter 3 consecutive task failures (configurable), the orchestrator pauses for 300 seconds before retrying. This prevents burning through rate limits or repeatedly hitting the same error.\n\n### Rate Limit Detection\n\nWhen Claude CLI output contains rate limit messages (\"You've hit your limit\"), the orchestrator:\n1. Parses the reset time from the message\n2. Calculates wait duration with timezone awareness\n3. Sleeps until reset + 30s buffer\n4. Resumes execution automatically\n\n### Graceful Stop\n\nTo stop the orchestrator between tasks without killing it:\n\n```bash\ntouch .claude/plans/.stop\n```\n\nThe orchestrator checks for this semaphore before each new task and exits cleanly. Remove it to allow future runs.\n\n### Post-Plan Smoke Tests\n\nAfter all tasks complete, the orchestrator can run Playwright smoke tests to verify the application still works:\n\n```bash\n# Enabled by default (looks for tests/SMOKE01-critical-paths.spec.ts)\npython scripts/plan-orchestrator.py --plan .claude/plans/my-feature.yaml\n\n# Disable smoke tests\npython scripts/plan-orchestrator.py --plan .claude/plans/my-feature.yaml --skip-smoke\n```\n\n### Plan Modification by Claude\n\nClaude can modify the YAML plan during execution:\n- **Split tasks**: Large task 2.1 becomes 2.1a, 2.1b, 2.1c\n- **Add tasks**: Insert discovered work\n- **Skip tasks**: Mark unnecessary tasks as skipped\n- **Self-extending plans**: A task can append new tasks and set `plan_modified: true`\n\nSet `plan_modified: true` in the status file to trigger a plan reload.\n\n### Verbose / Streaming Output\n\nUse `--verbose` for real-time streaming of Claude's output via `--output-format stream-json`:\n\n```bash\npython scripts/plan-orchestrator.py --plan .claude/plans/my-feature.yaml --verbose\n```\n\n## Auto-Pipeline\n\nThe auto-pipeline daemon (`scripts/auto-pipeline.py`) watches backlog folders and drives the orchestrator automatically:\n\n```bash\n# Watch backlogs and process items\npython scripts/auto-pipeline.py\n\n# Single pass (process one item, then exit)\npython scripts/auto-pipeline.py --once\n\n# Dry run\npython scripts/auto-pipeline.py --dry-run\n\n# Verbose output\npython scripts/auto-pipeline.py --verbose\n```\n\nThe auto-pipeline:\n1. Monitors `docs/defect-backlog/` and `docs/feature-backlog/` for new `.md` files\n2. Prioritizes defects over features; respects `## Dependencies` between items\n3. For each item: Claude creates a design + YAML plan, then the orchestrator executes it\n4. For defects: runs an independent verification step to confirm symptoms are resolved\n5. If verification fails: deletes stale plan, retries with findings (up to 3 cycles)\n6. Archives completed items to `completed/` subdirectories\n7. Shares the `.stop` semaphore with the orchestrator for coordinated shutdown\n\nRequires: `pip install watchdog pyyaml`\n\n### Defect Verification Loop\n\nFor defects, the auto-pipeline runs a verify-then-fix cycle after the orchestrator completes:\n\n```\nPhase 1: Create plan      --> Phase 2: Execute plan\n                                        |\n                              Phase 3: Verify symptoms\n                                    |           |\n                                  PASS        FAIL\n                                    |           |\n                              Phase 4:    Delete stale plan,\n                              Archive     loop to Phase 1\n                                          (findings in defect file\n                                           inform the next plan)\n```\n\nThe verifier is a read-only Claude session that checks whether the reported symptoms are actually resolved. It appends structured findings to the defect file, which the next plan-creation step reads to produce a targeted fix.\n\n### Project Configuration\n\nCustomize build and test commands in `.claude/orchestrator-config.yaml`:\n\n```yaml\n# Build/test commands used during verification (defaults shown)\n# build_command: \"pnpm run build\"\n# test_command: \"pnpm test\"\n# dev_server_command: \"pnpm dev\"\n# dev_server_port: 3000\n```\n\n### Backlog Item Format\n\nWrite backlog items as markdown files in `docs/defect-backlog/` or `docs/feature-backlog/`:\n\n```markdown\n# Brief Title\n\n## Status: Open\n\n## Priority: High\n\n## Summary\nWhat this defect/feature is about.\n\n## Expected Behavior\nWhat should happen.\n\n## Actual Behavior\nWhat actually happens (for defects).\n\n## Fix Required\nSpecific steps or criteria for the fix.\n\n## Verification\nHow to verify the fix is correct.\n\n## Dependencies\n- 02-other-feature.md\n```\n\nKey conventions:\n- Filenames use `NN-slug-name.md` format (e.g., `01-fix-login-bug.md`)\n- `## Status: Fixed` or `## Status: Completed` marks items as done (auto-pipeline skips them)\n- `## Dependencies` lists other backlog slugs that must be completed first\n- Items in `completed/` subdirectories are ignored\n- Items in `on-hold/` subdirectories are ignored\n\n## Manual Execution\n\nYou can also run tasks manually using the `/implement` command in Claude Code:\n\n```\n/implement        # Run next pending task\n/implement 2.1    # Run specific task by ID\n```\n\n## How It Works\n\n1. **Find Next Task**: Orchestrator finds first `pending` or `in_progress` task (respecting dependencies)\n2. **Build Prompt**: Creates prompt with task details, plan document reference, and coordination instructions\n3. **Execute Claude**: Runs `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions --print <prompt>` in a fresh session\n4. **Check Status**: Reads `.claude/plans/task-status.json` for result\n5. **Update Plan**: Marks task complete/failed in YAML\n6. **Commit**: Auto-commits changes to git\n7. **Repeat**: Continues until all tasks done, circuit breaker trips, or stop semaphore detected\n\n### Status File Protocol\n\nClaude writes its status to `.claude/plans/task-status.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"task_id\": \"1.1\",\n  \"status\": \"completed\",\n  \"message\": \"What was accomplished\",\n  \"timestamp\": \"2026-01-20T12:00:00Z\",\n  \"plan_modified\": false\n}\n```\n\n### Task Statuses\n\n- `pending` - Not yet started\n- `in_progress` - Currently being executed\n- `completed` - Successfully finished\n- `failed` - Failed after max attempts\n- `skipped` - Manually skipped with reason\n\n## Subagent Coordination Protocol\n\nWhen running parallel tasks, each Claude session follows a coordination protocol:\n\n1. **File Claims**: Before editing a file, check/claim it in `.claude/agent-claims.json`\n2. **Heartbeats**: Update `.claude/subagent-status/{agent-id}.json` periodically\n3. **Conflict Detection**: The orchestrator checks for file conflicts before spawning parallel tasks\n4. **Stale Claim Cleanup**: Heartbeat-based detection of abandoned claims\n\nSee `.claude/skills/implement/SKILL.md` for the full protocol details.\n\n## Directory Structure\n\n```\nyour-project/\n├── CODING-RULES.md                   # Coding standards (adapt for your project)\n├── .claude/\n│   ├── plans/\n│   │   ├── sample-plan.yaml        # Template plan\n│   │   ├── my-feature.yaml         # Your active plan\n│   │   ├── task-status.json        # Auto-generated status\n│   │   └── .stop                   # Graceful stop semaphore\n│   ├── skills/\n│   │   └── implement/\n│   │       └── SKILL.md            # Implementation skill\n│   ├── commands/\n│   │   └── implement.md            # /implement command\n│   ├── subagent-status/            # Parallel task heartbeats\n│   └── agent-claims.json           # File claim coordination\n├── scripts/\n│   ├── plan-orchestrator.py        # Main orchestrator (~2095 lines)\n│   └── auto-pipeline.py            # Auto-pipeline daemon (~1450 lines)\n└── docs/\n    ├── plans/\n    │   └── YYYY-MM-DD-*.md         # Design documents\n    └── narrative/\n        └── *.md                    # Development history\n```\n\n## Tips\n\n1. **Start Small**: Test with 2-3 tasks before running large plans\n2. **Detailed Designs**: The design doc is crucial - be specific about file paths and steps\n3. **Use Dependencies**: Declare `depends_on` to ensure correct execution order\n4. **Parallel Where Possible**: Group independent tasks with `parallel_group` for faster execution\n5. **Graceful Stop**: Use `touch .claude/plans/.stop` instead of killing the process\n6. **Self-Extending Plans**: Let Claude add tasks during execution with `plan_modified: true`\n7. **Monitor Progress**: Check the YAML file for status updates during execution\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n**Task keeps failing:**\n- Check the error message in `last_error` field\n- Increase `max_attempts` for complex tasks (default: 3, max recommended: 5)\n- Simplify the task description\n- The circuit breaker trips after 3 consecutive failures (300s cooldown)\n\n**Parallel tasks conflict:**\n- Use `exclusive_resources` to prevent shared-resource tasks from running together\n- The conflict detector checks file paths in task descriptions before spawning\n\n**Rate limit hit:**\n- The orchestrator auto-detects and waits for rate limit reset\n- Check the output for \"Rate limit detected\" messages\n\n**Claude doesn't write status file:**\n- Ensure the implement skill is in `.claude/skills/implement/SKILL.md`\n- Check Claude has write access to `.claude/plans/`\n\n**Graceful stop not working:**\n- Ensure the `.stop` file is in `.claude/plans/.stop` (not the project root)\n- The check happens before each new task, not during execution\n\n**Stale worktrees after crash:**\n- Run `git worktree list` and `git worktree remove <path>` for orphans\n- The orchestrator attempts cleanup, but crashes may leave worktrees behind\n\n## Development History\n\nThe orchestrator evolved from a 454-line sequential executor to a ~3500-line parallel execution engine (across two scripts) over the course of building a production application. See [docs/narrative/](docs/narrative/) for the complete development history, including:\n\n- Genesis and initial design decisions\n- Parallel execution via git worktrees\n- Subagent coordination protocol\n- Hardening (graceful stop, binary resolution, stale branch cleanup)\n- Rate limit detection and resilience\n- Smoke tests and streaming output\n- Auto-pipeline daemon\n- Lessons learned and open questions\n- Fixing the parallel merge strategy\n- Design competitions: parallel design generation with AI judge\n- Verification loop: independent symptom verification for defects\n\n## License\n\nMIT License - see [LICENSE](LICENSE)\n","numLines":500,"startLine":1,"totalLines":500}}}
