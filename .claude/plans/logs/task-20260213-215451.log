Read the CLAUDE.md file for project conventions\n5. If the backlog item has a ## Verification Log section, READ IT CAREFULLY.\n   Previous fix attempts and their verification results are recorded there.\n   Your plan MUST address any unresolved findings from prior verifications.\n\n## What to produce\n\n1. Create a design document at: docs/plans/{date}-{slug}-design.md\n   - Brief architecture overview\n   - Key files to create/modify\n   - Design decisions\n\n2. Create a YAML plan at: .claude/plans/{slug}.yaml\n   - Use the exact format: meta + sections with nested tasks\n   - Each section has: id, name, status: pending, tasks: [...]\n   - Each task has: id, name, description, status: pending\n   - Task descriptions should be detailed enough for a fresh Claude session to execute\n   - Include: documentation tasks, implementation tasks, unit tests, verification\n   - The verification task should run pnpm run build and pnpm test\n\n3. Validate the plan: python scripts/plan-orchestrator.py --plan .claude/plans/{slug}.yaml --dry-run\n   - If validation fails, fix the YAML format and retry\n\n4. Git commit both files with message: \"plan: add {slug} design and YAML plan\"\n\n## Backlog item type: {item_type}\n\n## Important\n- Follow the CLAUDE.md change workflow order: docs -> code -> tests -> verification\n- For defects: include a task to verify the fix with a regression test\n- For features: include documentation, implementation, unit tests, and E2E tests as appropriate\n- Keep tasks focused - each task should be completable in one Claude session (under 10 minutes)\n- If the backlog item has a ## Verification Log with unresolved findings, your plan\n  must specifically address those findings.

Read the CLAUDE.md file for project conventions\n5. If the backlog item has a ## Verification Log section, READ IT CAREFULLY.\n   Previous fix attempts and their verification results are recorded there.\n   Your plan MUST address any unresolved findings from prior verifications.\n\n## What to produce\n\n1. Create a design document at: docs/plans/{date}-{slug}-design.md\n   - Brief architecture overview\n   - Key files to create/modify\n   - Design decisions\n\n2. Create a YAML plan at: .claude/plans/{slug}.yaml\n   - Use the exact format: meta + sections with nested tasks\n   - Each section has: id, name, status: pending, tasks: [...]\n   - Each task has: id, name, description, status: pending\n   - Task descriptions should be detailed enough for a fresh Claude session to execute\n   - Include: documentation tasks, implementation tasks, unit tests, verification\n   - The verification task should run pnpm run build and pnpm test\n\n3. Validate the plan: python scripts/plan-orchestrator.py --plan .claude/plans/{slug}.yaml --dry-run\n   - If validation fails, fix the YAML format and retry\n\n4. Git commit both files with message: \"plan: add {slug} design and YAML plan\"\n\n## Backlog item type: {item_type}\n\n## Important\n- Follow the CLAUDE.md change workflow order: docs -> code -> tests -> verification\n- For defects: include a task to verify the fix with a regression test\n- For features: include documentation, implementation, unit tests, and E2E tests as appropriate\n- Keep tasks focused - each task should be completable in one Claude session (under 10 minutes)\n- If the backlog item has a ## Verification Log with unresolved findings, your plan\n  must specifically address those findings.

Read the backlog item file: {item_path}\n2. Read procedure-coding-rules.md for coding standards\n3. Read an existing YAML plan for format reference: look at .claude/plans/*.yaml files\n4. Read the CLAUDE.md file for project conventions\n5. If the backlog item has a ## Verification Log section, READ IT CAREFULLY.\n   Previous fix attempts and their verification results are recorded there.\n   Your plan MUST address any unresolved findings from prior verifications.\n\n## What to produce\n\n1. Create a design document at: docs/plans/{date}-{slug}-design.md\n   - Brief architecture overview\n   - Key files to create/modify\n   - Design decisions\n\n2. Create a YAML plan at: .claude/plans/{slug}.yaml\n   - Use the exact format: meta + sections with nested tasks\n   - Each section has: id, name, status: pending, tasks: [...]\n   - Each task has: id, name, description, status: pending\n   - Task descriptions should be detailed enough for a fresh Claude session to execute\n   - Include: documentation tasks, implementation tasks, unit tests, verification\n   - The verification task should run pnpm run build and pnpm test\n\n3. Validate the plan: python scripts/plan-orchestrator.py --plan .claude/plans/{slug}.yaml --dry-run\n   - If validation fails, fix the YAML format and retry\n\n4. Git commit both files with message: \"plan: add {slug} design and YAML plan\"\n\n## Backlog item type: {item_type}\n\n## Important\n- Follow the CLAUDE.md change workflow order: docs -> code -> tests -> verification\n- For defects: include a task to verify the fix with a regression test\n- For features: include documentation, implementation, unit tests, and E2E tests as appropriate\n- Keep tasks focused - each task should be completable in one Claude session (under 10 minutes)\n- If the backlog item has a ## Verification Log with unresolved findings, your plan\n  must specifically address those findings.
