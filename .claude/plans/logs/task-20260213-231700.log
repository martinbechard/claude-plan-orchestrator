Plugin Manifest (plugin.json)\n\nThe plugin.json lives at the project root and declares:\n- name: \"plan-orchestrator\"\n- version: \"1.0.0\" (semver)\n- description: from README first paragraph\n- author: \"martinbechard\"\n- repository: GitHub URL\n- license: \"MIT\"\n- keywords: [\"orchestrator\", \"plan\", \"automation\", \"parallel\"]\n- entry points: agents, skills, commands directories under .claude/\n\nThe manifest maps the .claude/ subdirectories as plugin components. Claude Code discovers agents from .claude/agents/, skills from .claude/skills/, and commands from .claude/commands/ automatically.\n\n### 2. CODING-RULES as a Skill (Progressive Disclosure)\n\nPackage CODING-RULES.md with progressive disclosure:\n- .claude/skills/coding-rules/SKILL.md - concise entry point (summary of rules with references)\n- CODING-RULES.md stays at root as the full reference document\n- SKILL.md references CODING-RULES.md for full details when needed\n\nRole-specific subsets are NOT implemented in this phase. The full rules document is small enough to serve all agent roles. Role-specific subsets can be added later if needed.\n\n### 3. Marketplace Configuration\n\nmarketplace.json at project root enables team discovery:\n- Points to the GitHub repository\n- Declares compatible Claude Code versions\n- Includes installation instructions\n\n### 4. Manual-Copy Fallback Preserved\n\nThe README keeps the manual-copy instructions in a \"Manual Installation (Alternative)\" section. This ensures existing users are not broken and provides a fallback for environments where plugin install is not available.\n\n### 5. Version Strategy\n\nStart at 1.0.0. The project is functional and has been used in production. Future versions follow semver. CHANGELOG.md tracks all releases.\n\n### 6. Scripts Accessibility\n\nThe scripts/ directory (plan-orchestrator.py, auto-pipeline.py) must remain accessible after plugin install. Claude Code plugins expose their directory path, so scripts can be run via the plugin path. The README documents this with examples.\n\n---\n\n## Verification Strategy\n\n1. Validate plugin.json syntax with Python json.load\n2. Verify plugin install from local directory (--plugin-dir)\n3. Verify skills, commands, agents are discovered correctly\n4. Verify manual-copy workflow still works\n5. Dry-run orchestrator to confirm no regressions\n","numLines":123,"startLine":1,"totalLines":123}}}

These rules apply to any project\n     4→using the plan orchestrator. Adapt the examples to your language and framework.\n     5→\n     6→Each rule explains **why** it exists (the BECAUSE chain), so the AI can make correct\n     7→judgment calls when the letter of the rule doesn't quite fit the situation.\n     8→\n     9→---\n    10→\n    11→## 0. File Headers and Design Traceability\n    12→\n    13→- **RULE:** Every source file MUST include a header comment with:\n    14→  - File path (relative to project root)\n    15→  - One-line summary of the file's purpose\n    16→  - Reference to the design document that defines its behavior (if one exists)\n    17→  - **BECAUSE:** Headers create an explicit link between implementation and specification,\n    18→    preventing architectural drift.\n    19→  - **BECAUSE:** When an AI agent picks up a task in a fresh session, the header tells it\n    20→    where to find the design context without searching.\n    21→\n    22→- **RULE:** Before modifying existing code, ALWAYS verify changes against the design document\n    23→  referenced in the header. If there is a discrepancy, raise the issue rather than silently\n    24→  diverging.\n    25→  - **BECAUSE:** Ensures implementation continues to align with the agreed-upon specification.\n    26→  - **BECAUSE:** Catches unintended deviations early, before they cascade.\n    27→\n    28→- **RULE:** Major design changes or significant refactorings MUST be discussed and approved\n    29→  before implementation.\n    30→  - **BECAUSE:** Prevents costly rework if changes are later deemed undesirable.\n    31→  - **BECAUSE:** In an orchestrated plan, one agent's unauthorized design change can break\n    32→    assumptions held by subsequent tasks.\n    33→\n    34→- **RULE:** Design documents are the single source of truth for module behavior. When changing\n    35→  code, the corresponding design doc MUST be updated to reflect the changes. Conversely, when\n    36→  code seems incorrect, consult the design doc to understand the intended behavior.\n    37→  - **BECAUSE:** Synchronized design and code reduces confusion and prevents drift.\n    38→  - **BECAUSE:** Design documents provide essential context for recovering intended behavior.\n    39→\n    40→- **RULE:** After implementing changes and ensuring tests pass, ALWAYS perform a code review\n    41→  (manual or automated) against the project's standards.\n    42→  - **BECAUSE:** Code reviews catch issues that tests cannot: readability, maintainability,\n    43→    adherence to conventions, and subtle logic errors.\n    44→\n    45→## 1. Naming Conventions\n    46→\n    47→- **RULE:** Follow your language's community conventions consistently:\n    48→  - **PascalCase** for classes, interfaces, type definitions, React components\n    49→  - **camelCase** for variables, functions, methods, utility files\n    50→  - **ALL_CAPS_SNAKE_CASE** for manifest constants (values that never change at runtime)\n    51→  - **kebab-case** for configuration files and non-code assets\n    52→  - **BECAUSE:** Predictable naming reduces cognitive load. You can tell a file's purpose\n    53→    from its casing alone.\n    54→\n    55→- **RULE:** File names containing a single primary class or component MUST be named to match\n    56→  that class (e.g., `StatusManager.ts` for class `StatusManager`).\n    57→  - **BECAUSE:** Creates a predictable mapping between the artifact and the filesystem,\n    58→    reducing time spent searching for definitions.\n    59→\n    60→- **RULE:** Variable, function, and method names MUST be clear, descriptive, and reflect their\n    61→  purpose. Avoid cryptic abbreviations or overly generic names (e.g., `data`, `manager`, `temp`).\n    62→  - **BECAUSE:** The name itself should convey intent and nature, reducing the need for\n    63→    comments and preventing ambiguity.\n    64→\n    65→- **RULE:** Function/method names SHOULD indicate their purpose through word choice:\n    66→  - **Nouns/noun phrases** for functions that retrieve without side effects:\n    67→    `orderCount`, `getUserProfile`, `isActive`\n    68→  - **Verbs/verb phrases** for functions that alter state or perform actions:\n    69→    `updateStatus`, `calculateTotal`, `saveConfiguration`\n    70→  - **BECAUSE:** Signals to the reader whether calling the function might change system state.\n    71→    This is the Command-Query Separation principle.\n    72→\n    73→- **RULE:** Avoid variable names that are easily confused (e.g., `orderCount` vs `orderCounts`\n    74→  for different concepts). Be precise.\n    75→  - **BECAUSE:** Subtle naming differences for distinct concepts lead to hard-to-find bugs.\n    76→\n    77→- **RULE:** Naming conventions MUST be applied consistently across the entire codebase.\n    78→  - **BECAUSE:** A uniform style makes the codebase feel cohesive and easier to navigate.\n    79→\n    80→## 2. File Organization and Imports\n    81→\n    82→- **RULE:** Organize files into standard top-level directories based on their category:\n    83→  - `src/` - All primary source code\n    84→  - `scripts/` - Utility scripts for build, deployment, development tasks\n    85→  - `docs/` - Documentation, design documents, plans\n    86→  - `test/` or `tests/` - Test code, mocks, fixtures\n    87→  - **BECAUSE:** Establishes a conventional structure that makes it easy to locate artifacts\n    88→    and clearly separates source from supporting files.\n    89→\n    90→- **RULE:** Separate shared contracts from implementation:\n    91→  - Shared interfaces/types/constants should live in dedicated directories\n    92→    (e.g., `src/interfaces/`, `src/types/`, `src/constants/`)\n    93→  - Items used only within a single module may remain co-located in that module\n    94→  - **BECAUSE:** Centralizing shared contracts improves discoverability and prevents\n    95→    scattering definitions across modules.\n    96→  - **BECAUSE:** Clearly separates public API contracts from internal implementation details.\n    97→\n    98→- **RULE:** Any single source file exceeding 200 lines SHOULD be refactored into a module\n    99→  folder with an entry point (`index.ts`, `__init__.py`, etc.) that exports only the\n   100→  public API.\n   101→  - **BECAUSE:** Prevents excessively long files that are hard to read, understand, and maintain.\n   102→  - **BECAUSE:** Enforces a clear public API for each component.\n   103→\n   104→- **RULE:** Module entry points (e.g., `index.ts`) MUST only contain import/export statements.\n   105→  No implementation logic.\n   106→  - **BECAUSE:** The entry point defines the public contract. Mixing in logic blurs the boundary.\n   107→\n   108→- **RULE:** Each exported class SHOULD reside in its own distinct file.\n   109→  - **BECAUSE:** One file, one purpose. Makes code review and maintenance simpler.\n   110→\n   111→- **RULE:** Test files MUST mirror the source directory structure.\n   112→  - **EXAMPLE:** Tests for `src/services/workflow/Executor.ts` go in\n   113→    `test/services/workflow/Executor.test.ts`.\n   114→  - **BECAUSE:** Clear, predictable relationship between code and its tests.\n   115→\n   116→- **RULE:** Before creating a new file for a type, interface, or class, check whether a\n   117→  suitable definition already exists. If it does, import it. If it does not, create it in\n   118→  the correct location and register it in whatever central registry the project uses.\n   119→  - **BECAUSE:** Prevents duplication and ensures a single source of truth for definitions.\n   120→\n   121→- **RULE:** Organize imports logically: external libraries first, then project-level aliases,\n   122→  then relative imports. Remove all unused imports.\n   123→  - **BECAUSE:** Consistent organization improves readability and makes dependencies clearer.\n   124→  - **BECAUSE:** Unused imports clutter code and can cause confusion during refactoring.\n   125→\n   126→- **RULE:** Actively avoid and resolve circular dependencies between modules.\n   127→  - **BECAUSE:** Circular dependencies cause runtime errors, make code harder to test,\n   128→    and hinder modularity. Separating contracts into shared directories can break cycles.\n   129→\n   130→## 3. Code Structure and Readability\n   131→\n   132→- **RULE:** Methods SHOULD NOT exceed 30-40 lines. Extract complex logic into helper methods.\n   133→  - **BECAUSE:** Shorter methods are easier to understand, test, and maintain. They tend to\n   134→    have a single responsibility.\n   135→\n   136→- **RULE:** Classes SHOULD NOT exceed 300 lines. If a class grows beyond this, refactor into\n   137→  a module folder.\n   138→  - **BECAUSE:** Large classes often violate the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and\n   139→    are hard to manage.\n   140→\n   141→- **RULE:** Functions accepting more than two parameters MUST use a parameter object.\n   142→  Name the type descriptively (e.g., `CreateUserParams`, `SearchOptions`).\n   143→  - **BECAUSE:** Parameter objects improve readability and maintainability, especially when\n   144→    adding or removing parameters.\n   145→\n   146→- **RULE:** Prioritize code clarity and correctness over premature abstraction. Apply\n   147→  abstractions when patterns are clear, not speculatively.\n   148→  - **BECAUSE:** Maintainability and understandability come first. Three similar lines are\n   149→    better than a premature abstraction that nobody understands.\n   150→\n   151→- **RULE:** Focus on minimal, necessary changes to achieve the goal. Avoid over-engineering.\n   152→  - **BECAUSE:** Simpler solutions are easier to understand, test, and maintain.\n   153→  - **BECAUSE:** Minimizing scope reduces the risk of unintended side effects.\n   154→  - **BECAUSE:** In orchestrated plans, each task should do one thing well. Gold-plating\n   155→    delays the plan and introduces risk.\n   156→\n   157→## 4. Types and Type Safety\n   158→\n   159→- **RULE:** Never use `any` as a type. Always create proper types for groups of fields.\n   160→  TypeScript is all about types; using `any` defeats the purpose.\n   161→  - **BECAUSE:** `any` bypasses all type checking, hiding bugs that the compiler would\n   162→    otherwise catch.\n   163→\n   164→- **RULE:** Use the correct construct for the purpose:\n   165→  - `interface` for contracts that classes can implement or objects must adhere to\n   166→  - `type` for data shapes, function signatures, unions, intersections\n   167→  - `class` when behavior (methods), internal state, or inheritance is required\n   168→  - **BECAUSE:** Choosing the right construct signals intent and makes the code self-documenting.\n   169→\n   170→- **RULE:** Avoid \"Primitive Obsession.\" Use specific types instead of raw primitives\n   171→  (`string`, `number`, `boolean`) to represent domain concepts.\n   172→  - **EXAMPLE:** Use `type UserId = string` or `type Currency = 'USD' | 'EUR' | 'GBP'`\n   173→    instead of bare strings.\n   174→  - **BECAUSE:** Domain-specific types improve type safety, self-documentation, and\n   175→    centralize validation logic.\n   176→\n   177→- **RULE:** Groups of primitives that are always used together SHOULD be encapsulated in\n   178→  an interface or type.\n   179→  - **BECAUSE:** Improves cohesion and makes the relationship explicit.\n   180→\n   181→- **RULE:** Use type assertions (`as any`, `as unknown as Type`) sparingly, with\n   182→  justification. Fix underlying type mismatches instead.\n   183→  - **BECAUSE:** Type assertions bypass safety and can hide bugs.\n   184→\n   185→- **RULE:** Never pepper code with literal constants. Use manifest constants defined at the\n   186→  top of the file (or in a constants module) for any numeric or string value that has meaning.\n   187→  - **BECAUSE:** Magic numbers and strings are cryptic, error-prone, and hard to update.\n   188→  - **BECAUSE:** Constants with descriptive names make code self-documenting.\n   189→\n   190→## 5. Coupling and Cohesion\n   191→\n   192→- **RULE:** Classes MUST have a single, well-defined responsibility (Single Responsibility\n   193→  Principle / SRP). Each class should have one reason to change.\n   194→  - **BECAUSE:** High cohesion makes classes easier to understand, test, and maintain.\n   195→\n   196→- **RULE:** Methods MUST perform a single logical operation.\n   197→  - **BECAUSE:** Single-purpose methods are more readable and testable.\n   198→\n   199→- **RULE:** Minimize coupling between modules. Depend on interfaces rather than concrete\n   200→  implementations, especially across module boundaries.\n   201→  - **BECAUSE:** Loose coupling makes the system more flexible and resilient to change.\n   202→\n   203→- **RULE:** Do not access private members of other classes. Interact through the public API.\n   204→  - **BECAUSE:** Violating encapsulation creates tight coupling that breaks when internals change.\n   205→\n   206→- **RULE:** Avoid \"Feature Envy.\" If a method mostly operates on another class's data,\n   207→  move it to that class.\n   208→  - **BECAUSE:** Improves cohesion and reduces coupling.\n   209→\n   210→- **RULE:** Utility functions used by only one class SHOULD be private to that class or\n   211→  its module, not exported globally.\n   212→  - **BECAUSE:** Keeps related logic together and avoids polluting the module scope.\n   213→\n   214→## 6. Error Handling\n   215→\n   216→- **RULE:** Avoid empty `catch` blocks. Always log the error or re-throw appropriately.\n   217→  - **BECAUSE:** Empty catches silently swallow errors, hiding problems that compound over time.\n   218→\n   219→- **RULE:** Do not use exceptions for normal control flow. Use conditional logic instead.\n   220→  - **BECAUSE:** Misusing exceptions is inefficient and obscures the actual logic.\n   221→\n   222→- **RULE:** Provide clear, informative error messages that include context (what was being\n   223→  attempted, what values were involved).\n   224→  - **BECAUSE:** Good error messages cut debugging time from hours to minutes.\n   225→\n   226→- **RULE:** When logging, always include variable names alongside values:\n   227→  `log(\"Failed to process order: orderId=${orderId}, status=${status}\")`\n   228→  - **BECAUSE:** Knowing which variable holds which value makes trace logs dramatically\n   229→    easier to read.\n   230→\n   231→- **RULE:** When troubleshooting unexpected values, consider whether the variable name is\n   232→  misleading. Rename for clarity if so.\n   233→  - **BECAUSE:** Clear naming aids debugging by making intent explicit.\n   234→\n   235→## 7. Comments and Documentation\n   236→\n   237→- **RULE:** Every exported function, interface, type, class, and global variable MUST have\n   238→  a doc comment (JSDoc, docstring, etc.) explaining its purpose.\n   239→  - **BECAUSE:** Documentation alongside the code improves understanding and maintainability.\n   240→\n   241→- **RULE:** Write comments to explain _why_, not _what_. The code should explain the what.\n   242→  Focus on rationale, business rules, workarounds, and non-obvious decisions.\n   243→  - **BECAUSE:** The \"why\" is context that code alone cannot convey.\n   244→\n   245→- **RULE:** Remove commented-out code. That's what version control is for.\n   246→  - **BECAUSE:** Commented code is noise that becomes outdated and confusing.\n   247→\n   248→- **RULE:** Ensure comments are accurate and up-to-date. Fix or remove misleading ones.\n   249→  - **BECAUSE:** An incorrect comment is worse than no comment.\n   250→\n   251→- **RULE:** Avoid excessive comments. If you feel the need to comment heavily, refactor\n   252→  the code for clarity instead (better naming, smaller functions, clearer structure).\n   253→  - **BECAUSE:** Self-documenting code is preferred. Comments that restate the obvious add\n   254→    clutter.\n   255→\n   256→- **RULE:** Remove development-phase comments (TODO, FIXME, attribution) before task\n   257→  completion. Use task trackers and commit messages instead.\n   258→  - **BECAUSE:** Stale TODOs accumulate as noise. The orchestrator's YAML plan is the\n   259→    proper place to track remaining work.\n   260→\n   261→## 8. Conditional Logic\n   262→\n   263→- **RULE:** Avoid large `switch` statements or long `if/else if/else` chains.\n   264→  - **BECAUSE:** Hard to read, maintain, and extend. Often violates the Open-Closed Principle.\n   265→\n   266→- **RULE:** Consider polymorphism (via interfaces) or lookup maps/objects instead of\n   267→  complex conditionals.\n   268→  - **BECAUSE:** Leads to cleaner, more extensible, and testable designs.\n   269→\n   270→## 9. UI Feedback Patterns\n   271→\n   272→- **RULE:** Before implementing success/error notifications in a component, check for\n   273→  existing toast, notification, or alert components in the project's UI library.\n   274→  - **BECAUSE:** Reusing the existing notification system ensures visual consistency and UX\n   275→    quality.\n   276→  - **BECAUSE:** Inline state-based message divs (`{error && <div>...</div>}`) create\n   277→    visual inconsistency, shift content, and require manual cleanup (setTimeout, etc.).\n   278→\n   279→- **RULE:** Use the project's established notification system for all user feedback. Do not\n   280→  add inline success/error state variables for displaying feedback messages.\n   281→  - **BECAUSE:** A centralized notification system handles auto-dismiss, positioning, and\n   282→    styling consistently.\n   283→\n   284→## 10. Build and Dev Server Management\n   285→\n   286→- **RULE:** After code changes, do not assume hot module replacement (HMR) will pick them up.\n   287→  When in doubt, restart the dev server.\n   288→  - **BECAUSE:** HMR is unreliable for many change types (new imports, structural changes,\n   289→    hook changes). A restart takes seconds and guarantees a clean state.\n   290→\n   291→- **RULE:** When the dev server shows manifest or module errors, restart the server first\n   292→  before attempting cache cleanup.\n   293→  - **BECAUSE:** A restart solves the vast majority of these issues instantly.\n   294→\n   295→- **RULE:** Always stop the dev server before running a production build. Dev caches and\n   296→  build caches can conflict.\n   297→  - **BECAUSE:** Cache conflicts produce mysterious errors that waste debugging time.\n   298→\n   299→- **RULE:** Never use `--no-lint` when building new code. It hides errors.\n   300→  - **BECAUSE:** Lint errors often indicate real problems. Suppressing them creates\n   301→    technical debt.\n   302→\n   303→## 11. Test Discipline\n   304→\n   305→- **RULE:** After ANY code change, run the related tests before moving on.\n   306→  - **BECAUSE:** Catching regressions immediately is orders of magnitude cheaper than\n   307→    finding them later.\n   308→\n   309→- **RULE:** Failing tests are YOUR responsibility. Fix them immediately --- do not defer or\n   310→  assume they were \"already broken.\"\n   311→  - **BECAUSE:** In an AI-orchestrated workflow, you are the sole developer. All failures\n   312→    result from your changes. Leaving them creates compounding tech debt.\n   313→\n   314→- **RULE:** TypeScript errors in test files count as broken tests.\n   315→  - **BECAUSE:** If it doesn't compile, it doesn't test.\n   316→\n   317→- **RULE:** When splitting large test suites, migrate incrementally: move one test group\n   318→  at a time, verify it passes, then continue.\n   319→  - **BECAUSE:** Incremental migration minimizes risk and ensures continuous validity.\n   320→\n   321→## 12. AI-Specific Discipline\n   322→\n   323→These rules address failure modes specific to AI code generation.\n   324→\n   325→- **RULE:** Never remove existing functionality when asked to \"clean up\" or \"simplify.\"\n   326→  Ask before removing any feature, field, or calculation.\n   327→  - **BECAUSE:** AIs sometimes interpret \"simplify\" as \"delete.\" Working features are never\n   328→    clutter.\n   329→\n   330→- **RULE:** Do not add features, refactor code, or make \"improvements\" beyond what was asked.\n   331→  A bug fix doesn't need surrounding code cleaned up. A simple feature doesn't need extra\n   332→  configurability.\n   333→  - **BECAUSE:** Over-engineering is a common AI failure mode. Each unnecessary addition\n   334→    introduces risk and costs tokens.\n   335→\n   336→- **RULE:** When a value is NULL or missing, show that state honestly (0, empty,\n   337→  \"Not configured\"). Do not invent fallback logic to show data from unrelated sources.\n   338→  - **BECAUSE:** Invented fallbacks mask real problems and confuse users who expect to see\n   339→    actual state.\n   340→\n   341→- **RULE:** Never use \"file is too large\" as an excuse to defer work. If a file is too large,\n   342→  split it into smaller modules and integrate them immediately.\n   343→  - **BECAUSE:** \"Deferred\" is not a valid status. Work is either done or needs to be done now.\n   344→\n   345→- **RULE:** Commit frequently. Uncommitted work is lost when the session ends.\n   346→  - **BECAUSE:** In an orchestrated workflow, each task runs in a fresh session.

These rules apply to any project\nusing the plan orchestrator. Adapt the examples to your language and framework.\n\nEach rule explains **why** it exists (the BECAUSE chain), so the AI can make correct\njudgment calls when the letter of the rule doesn't quite fit the situation.\n\n---\n\n## 0. File Headers and Design Traceability\n\n- **RULE:** Every source file MUST include a header comment with:\n  - File path (relative to project root)\n  - One-line summary of the file's purpose\n  - Reference to the design document that defines its behavior (if one exists)\n  - **BECAUSE:** Headers create an explicit link between implementation and specification,\n    preventing architectural drift.\n  - **BECAUSE:** When an AI agent picks up a task in a fresh session, the header tells it\n    where to find the design context without searching.\n\n- **RULE:** Before modifying existing code, ALWAYS verify changes against the design document\n  referenced in the header. If there is a discrepancy, raise the issue rather than silently\n  diverging.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Ensures implementation continues to align with the agreed-upon specification.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Catches unintended deviations early, before they cascade.\n\n- **RULE:** Major design changes or significant refactorings MUST be discussed and approved\n  before implementation.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Prevents costly rework if changes are later deemed undesirable.\n  - **BECAUSE:** In an orchestrated plan, one agent's unauthorized design change can break\n    assumptions held by subsequent tasks.\n\n- **RULE:** Design documents are the single source of truth for module behavior. When changing\n  code, the corresponding design doc MUST be updated to reflect the changes. Conversely, when\n  code seems incorrect, consult the design doc to understand the intended behavior.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Synchronized design and code reduces confusion and prevents drift.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Design documents provide essential context for recovering intended behavior.\n\n- **RULE:** After implementing changes and ensuring tests pass, ALWAYS perform a code review\n  (manual or automated) against the project's standards.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Code reviews catch issues that tests cannot: readability, maintainability,\n    adherence to conventions, and subtle logic errors.\n\n## 1. Naming Conventions\n\n- **RULE:** Follow your language's community conventions consistently:\n  - **PascalCase** for classes, interfaces, type definitions, React components\n  - **camelCase** for variables, functions, methods, utility files\n  - **ALL_CAPS_SNAKE_CASE** for manifest constants (values that never change at runtime)\n  - **kebab-case** for configuration files and non-code assets\n  - **BECAUSE:** Predictable naming reduces cognitive load. You can tell a file's purpose\n    from its casing alone.\n\n- **RULE:** File names containing a single primary class or component MUST be named to match\n  that class (e.g., `StatusManager.ts` for class `StatusManager`).\n  - **BECAUSE:** Creates a predictable mapping between the artifact and the filesystem,\n    reducing time spent searching for definitions.\n\n- **RULE:** Variable, function, and method names MUST be clear, descriptive, and reflect their\n  purpose. Avoid cryptic abbreviations or overly generic names (e.g., `data`, `manager`, `temp`).\n  - **BECAUSE:** The name itself should convey intent and nature, reducing the need for\n    comments and preventing ambiguity.\n\n- **RULE:** Function/method names SHOULD indicate their purpose through word choice:\n  - **Nouns/noun phrases** for functions that retrieve without side effects:\n    `orderCount`, `getUserProfile`, `isActive`\n  - **Verbs/verb phrases** for functions that alter state or perform actions:\n    `updateStatus`, `calculateTotal`, `saveConfiguration`\n  - **BECAUSE:** Signals to the reader whether calling the function might change system state.\n    This is the Command-Query Separation principle.\n\n- **RULE:** Avoid variable names that are easily confused (e.g., `orderCount` vs `orderCounts`\n  for different concepts). Be precise.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Subtle naming differences for distinct concepts lead to hard-to-find bugs.\n\n- **RULE:** Naming conventions MUST be applied consistently across the entire codebase.\n  - **BECAUSE:** A uniform style makes the codebase feel cohesive and easier to navigate.\n\n## 2. File Organization and Imports\n\n- **RULE:** Organize files into standard top-level directories based on their category:\n  - `src/` - All primary source code\n  - `scripts/` - Utility scripts for build, deployment, development tasks\n  - `docs/` - Documentation, design documents, plans\n  - `test/` or `tests/` - Test code, mocks, fixtures\n  - **BECAUSE:** Establishes a conventional structure that makes it easy to locate artifacts\n    and clearly separates source from supporting files.\n\n- **RULE:** Separate shared contracts from implementation:\n  - Shared interfaces/types/constants should live in dedicated directories\n    (e.g., `src/interfaces/`, `src/types/`, `src/constants/`)\n  - Items used only within a single module may remain co-located in that module\n  - **BECAUSE:** Centralizing shared contracts improves discoverability and prevents\n    scattering definitions across modules.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Clearly separates public API contracts from internal implementation details.\n\n- **RULE:** Any single source file exceeding 200 lines SHOULD be refactored into a module\n  folder with an entry point (`index.ts`, `__init__.py`, etc.) that exports only the\n  public API.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Prevents excessively long files that are hard to read, understand, and maintain.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Enforces a clear public API for each component.\n\n- **RULE:** Module entry points (e.g., `index.ts`) MUST only contain import/export statements.\n  No implementation logic.\n  - **BECAUSE:** The entry point defines the public contract. Mixing in logic blurs the boundary.\n\n- **RULE:** Each exported class SHOULD reside in its own distinct file.\n  - **BECAUSE:** One file, one purpose. Makes code review and maintenance simpler.\n\n- **RULE:** Test files MUST mirror the source directory structure.\n  - **EXAMPLE:** Tests for `src/services/workflow/Executor.ts` go in\n    `test/services/workflow/Executor.test.ts`.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Clear, predictable relationship between code and its tests.\n\n- **RULE:** Before creating a new file for a type, interface, or class, check whether a\n  suitable definition already exists. If it does, import it. If it does not, create it in\n  the correct location and register it in whatever central registry the project uses.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Prevents duplication and ensures a single source of truth for definitions.\n\n- **RULE:** Organize imports logically: external libraries first, then project-level aliases,\n  then relative imports. Remove all unused imports.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Consistent organization improves readability and makes dependencies clearer.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Unused imports clutter code and can cause confusion during refactoring.\n\n- **RULE:** Actively avoid and resolve circular dependencies between modules.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Circular dependencies cause runtime errors, make code harder to test,\n    and hinder modularity. Separating contracts into shared directories can break cycles.\n\n## 3. Code Structure and Readability\n\n- **RULE:** Methods SHOULD NOT exceed 30-40 lines. Extract complex logic into helper methods.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Shorter methods are easier to understand, test, and maintain. They tend to\n    have a single responsibility.\n\n- **RULE:** Classes SHOULD NOT exceed 300 lines. If a class grows beyond this, refactor into\n  a module folder.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Large classes often violate the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and\n    are hard to manage.\n\n- **RULE:** Functions accepting more than two parameters MUST use a parameter object.\n  Name the type descriptively (e.g., `CreateUserParams`, `SearchOptions`).\n  - **BECAUSE:** Parameter objects improve readability and maintainability, especially when\n    adding or removing parameters.\n\n- **RULE:** Prioritize code clarity and correctness over premature abstraction. Apply\n  abstractions when patterns are clear, not speculatively.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Maintainability and understandability come first. Three similar lines are\n    better than a premature abstraction that nobody understands.\n\n- **RULE:** Focus on minimal, necessary changes to achieve the goal. Avoid over-engineering.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Simpler solutions are easier to understand, test, and maintain.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Minimizing scope reduces the risk of unintended side effects.\n  - **BECAUSE:** In orchestrated plans, each task should do one thing well. Gold-plating\n    delays the plan and introduces risk.\n\n## 4. Types and Type Safety\n\n- **RULE:** Never use `any` as a type. Always create proper types for groups of fields.\n  TypeScript is all about types; using `any` defeats the purpose.\n  - **BECAUSE:** `any` bypasses all type checking, hiding bugs that the compiler would\n    otherwise catch.\n\n- **RULE:** Use the correct construct for the purpose:\n  - `interface` for contracts that classes can implement or objects must adhere to\n  - `type` for data shapes, function signatures, unions, intersections\n  - `class` when behavior (methods), internal state, or inheritance is required\n  - **BECAUSE:** Choosing the right construct signals intent and makes the code self-documenting.\n\n- **RULE:** Avoid \"Primitive Obsession.\" Use specific types instead of raw primitives\n  (`string`, `number`, `boolean`) to represent domain concepts.\n  - **EXAMPLE:** Use `type UserId = string` or `type Currency = 'USD' | 'EUR' | 'GBP'`\n    instead of bare strings.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Domain-specific types improve type safety, self-documentation, and\n    centralize validation logic.\n\n- **RULE:** Groups of primitives that are always used together SHOULD be encapsulated in\n  an interface or type.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Improves cohesion and makes the relationship explicit.\n\n- **RULE:** Use type assertions (`as any`, `as unknown as Type`) sparingly, with\n  justification. Fix underlying type mismatches instead.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Type assertions bypass safety and can hide bugs.\n\n- **RULE:** Never pepper code with literal constants. Use manifest constants defined at the\n  top of the file (or in a constants module) for any numeric or string value that has meaning.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Magic numbers and strings are cryptic, error-prone, and hard to update.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Constants with descriptive names make code self-documenting.\n\n## 5. Coupling and Cohesion\n\n- **RULE:** Classes MUST have a single, well-defined responsibility (Single Responsibility\n  Principle / SRP). Each class should have one reason to change.\n  - **BECAUSE:** High cohesion makes classes easier to understand, test, and maintain.\n\n- **RULE:** Methods MUST perform a single logical operation.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Single-purpose methods are more readable and testable.\n\n- **RULE:** Minimize coupling between modules. Depend on interfaces rather than concrete\n  implementations, especially across module boundaries.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Loose coupling makes the system more flexible and resilient to change.\n\n- **RULE:** Do not access private members of other classes. Interact through the public API.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Violating encapsulation creates tight coupling that breaks when internals change.\n\n- **RULE:** Avoid \"Feature Envy.\" If a method mostly operates on another class's data,\n  move it to that class.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Improves cohesion and reduces coupling.\n\n- **RULE:** Utility functions used by only one class SHOULD be private to that class or\n  its module, not exported globally.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Keeps related logic together and avoids polluting the module scope.\n\n## 6. Error Handling\n\n- **RULE:** Avoid empty `catch` blocks. Always log the error or re-throw appropriately.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Empty catches silently swallow errors, hiding problems that compound over time.\n\n- **RULE:** Do not use exceptions for normal control flow. Use conditional logic instead.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Misusing exceptions is inefficient and obscures the actual logic.\n\n- **RULE:** Provide clear, informative error messages that include context (what was being\n  attempted, what values were involved).\n  - **BECAUSE:** Good error messages cut debugging time from hours to minutes.\n\n- **RULE:** When logging, always include variable names alongside values:\n  `log(\"Failed to process order: orderId=${orderId}, status=${status}\")`\n  - **BECAUSE:** Knowing which variable holds which value makes trace logs dramatically\n    easier to read.\n\n- **RULE:** When troubleshooting unexpected values, consider whether the variable name is\n  misleading. Rename for clarity if so.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Clear naming aids debugging by making intent explicit.\n\n## 7. Comments and Documentation\n\n- **RULE:** Every exported function, interface, type, class, and global variable MUST have\n  a doc comment (JSDoc, docstring, etc.) explaining its purpose.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Documentation alongside the code improves understanding and maintainability.\n\n- **RULE:** Write comments to explain _why_, not _what_. The code should explain the what.\n  Focus on rationale, business rules, workarounds, and non-obvious decisions.\n  - **BECAUSE:** The \"why\" is context that code alone cannot convey.\n\n- **RULE:** Remove commented-out code. That's what version control is for.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Commented code is noise that becomes outdated and confusing.\n\n- **RULE:** Ensure comments are accurate and up-to-date. Fix or remove misleading ones.\n  - **BECAUSE:** An incorrect comment is worse than no comment.\n\n- **RULE:** Avoid excessive comments. If you feel the need to comment heavily, refactor\n  the code for clarity instead (better naming, smaller functions, clearer structure).\n  - **BECAUSE:** Self-documenting code is preferred. Comments that restate the obvious add\n    clutter.\n\n- **RULE:** Remove development-phase comments (TODO, FIXME, attribution) before task\n  completion. Use task trackers and commit messages instead.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Stale TODOs accumulate as noise. The orchestrator's YAML plan is the\n    proper place to track remaining work.\n\n## 8. Conditional Logic\n\n- **RULE:** Avoid large `switch` statements or long `if/else if/else` chains.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Hard to read, maintain, and extend. Often violates the Open-Closed Principle.\n\n- **RULE:** Consider polymorphism (via interfaces) or lookup maps/objects instead of\n  complex conditionals.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Leads to cleaner, more extensible, and testable designs.\n\n## 9. UI Feedback Patterns\n\n- **RULE:** Before implementing success/error notifications in a component, check for\n  existing toast, notification, or alert components in the project's UI library.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Reusing the existing notification system ensures visual consistency and UX\n    quality.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Inline state-based message divs (`{error && <div>...</div>}`) create\n    visual inconsistency, shift content, and require manual cleanup (setTimeout, etc.).\n\n- **RULE:** Use the project's established notification system for all user feedback. Do not\n  add inline success/error state variables for displaying feedback messages.\n  - **BECAUSE:** A centralized notification system handles auto-dismiss, positioning, and\n    styling consistently.\n\n## 10. Build and Dev Server Management\n\n- **RULE:** After code changes, do not assume hot module replacement (HMR) will pick them up.\n  When in doubt, restart the dev server.\n  - **BECAUSE:** HMR is unreliable for many change types (new imports, structural changes,\n    hook changes). A restart takes seconds and guarantees a clean state.\n\n- **RULE:** When the dev server shows manifest or module errors, restart the server first\n  before attempting cache cleanup.\n  - **BECAUSE:** A restart solves the vast majority of these issues instantly.\n\n- **RULE:** Always stop the dev server before running a production build. Dev caches and\n  build caches can conflict.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Cache conflicts produce mysterious errors that waste debugging time.\n\n- **RULE:** Never use `--no-lint` when building new code. It hides errors.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Lint errors often indicate real problems. Suppressing them creates\n    technical debt.\n\n## 11. Test Discipline\n\n- **RULE:** After ANY code change, run the related tests before moving on.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Catching regressions immediately is orders of magnitude cheaper than\n    finding them later.\n\n- **RULE:** Failing tests are YOUR responsibility. Fix them immediately --- do not defer or\n  assume they were \"already broken.\"\n  - **BECAUSE:** In an AI-orchestrated workflow, you are the sole developer. All failures\n    result from your changes. Leaving them creates compounding tech debt.\n\n- **RULE:** TypeScript errors in test files count as broken tests.\n  - **BECAUSE:** If it doesn't compile, it doesn't test.\n\n- **RULE:** When splitting large test suites, migrate incrementally: move one test group\n  at a time, verify it passes, then continue.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Incremental migration minimizes risk and ensures continuous validity.\n\n## 12. AI-Specific Discipline\n\nThese rules address failure modes specific to AI code generation.\n\n- **RULE:** Never remove existing functionality when asked to \"clean up\" or \"simplify.\"\n  Ask before removing any feature, field, or calculation.\n  - **BECAUSE:** AIs sometimes interpret \"simplify\" as \"delete.\" Working features are never\n    clutter.\n\n- **RULE:** Do not add features, refactor code, or make \"improvements\" beyond what was asked.\n  A bug fix doesn't need surrounding code cleaned up. A simple feature doesn't need extra\n  configurability.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Over-engineering is a common AI failure mode. Each unnecessary addition\n    introduces risk and costs tokens.\n\n- **RULE:** When a value is NULL or missing, show that state honestly (0, empty,\n  \"Not configured\"). Do not invent fallback logic to show data from unrelated sources.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Invented fallbacks mask real problems and confuse users who expect to see\n    actual state.\n\n- **RULE:** Never use \"file is too large\" as an excuse to defer work. If a file is too large,\n  split it into smaller modules and integrate them immediately.\n  - **BECAUSE:** \"Deferred\" is not a valid status. Work is either done or needs to be done now.\n\n- **RULE:** Commit frequently. Uncommitted work is lost when the session ends.\n  - **BECAUSE:** In an orchestrated workflow, each task runs in a fresh session. If the task\n    doesn't commit, the work vanishes.\n\n---\n\n## Adapting These Rules\n\nThis document is a template. To adapt it for your project:\n\n1. **Add project-specific paths** - Replace generic directory examples with your actual\n   layout (e.g., `src/components/` for React, `app/models/` for Rails)\n2. **Add framework rules** - Add sections for your framework (e.g., React hooks rules,\n   Django model conventions, API design standards)\n3. **Add a definitions registry** - Consider maintaining a `definitions.md` that maps each\n   class/interface/type to its canonical file path and design document\n4. **Add your build commands** - Replace generic \"run the build\" with your actual commands\n   (e.g., `pnpm run build`, `cargo build`, `go build ./...`)\n5. **Reference from SKILL.md** - The implement skill's Step 3 says \"Read the project's\n   coding rules.\" Point it at this file.\n","numLines":365,"startLine":1,"totalLines":365}}}

The plugin installation replaces this with a single command:\n    12→\n    13→- **Automatic updates** -- run the install command again to get the latest version\n    14→- **Cleaner project directory** -- orchestrator files live in the plugin directory,\n    15→  not mixed into your project\n    16→- **No version drift** -- every project uses the same plugin version instead of\n    17→  whatever was copied at a given point in time\n    18→- **Simpler onboarding** -- new projects need only one install command\n    19→\n    20→---\n    21→\n    22→## Prerequisites\n    23→\n    24→- Claude Code CLI with plugin support\n    25→- An existing project that was set up using the manual-copy workflow\n    26→\n    27→---\n    28→\n    29→## Migration Steps\n    30→\n    31→### Step 1: Back Up Your Current .claude/ Directory\n    32→\n    33→Before making any changes, create a backup of your entire .claude/ directory:\n    34→\n    35→```bash\n    36→cp -r .claude .claude-backup\n    37→```\n    38→\n    39→This ensures you can restore everything if something goes wrong.\n    40→\n    41→### Step 2: Identify Your Project-Specific Files\n    42→\n    43→Your .claude/ directory contains two kinds of files:\n    44→\n    45→**Orchestrator-provided files** (will be replaced by the plugin):\n    46→\n    47→- .claude/agents/coder.md\n    48→- .claude/agents/code-reviewer.md\n    49→- .claude/skills/implement/SKILL.md\n    50→- .claude/skills/coding-rules/SKILL.md\n    51→- .claude/commands/implement.md\n    52→\n    53→**Project-provided files** (copied from the orchestrator repo as templates):\n    54→\n    55→- .claude/orchestrator-config.yaml\n    56→- .claude/plans/sample-plan.yaml\n    57→- CODING-RULES.md (at project root)\n    58→\n    59→**Your project-specific files** (created by you, must be preserved):\n    60→\n    61→- .claude/orchestrator-config.yaml (if you customized it)\n    62→- .claude/plans/*.yaml (your implementation plans)\n    63→- docs/plans/*.md (your design documents)\n    64→- CODING-RULES.md (if you customized it for your project)\n    65→\n    66→### Step 3: Remove Orchestrator-Provided Files\n    67→\n    68→Remove the files that the plugin will provide.

The plugin installation replaces this with a single command:\n\n- **Automatic updates** -- run the install command again to get the latest version\n- **Cleaner project directory** -- orchestrator files live in the plugin directory,\n  not mixed into your project\n- **No version drift** -- every project uses the same plugin version instead of\n  whatever was copied at a given point in time\n- **Simpler onboarding** -- new projects need only one install command\n\n---\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- Claude Code CLI with plugin support\n- An existing project that was set up using the manual-copy workflow\n\n---\n\n## Migration Steps\n\n### Step 1: Back Up Your Current .claude/ Directory\n\nBefore making any changes, create a backup of your entire .claude/ directory:\n\n```bash\ncp -r .claude .claude-backup\n```\n\nThis ensures you can restore everything if something goes wrong.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Your Project-Specific Files\n\nYour .claude/ directory contains two kinds of files:\n\n**Orchestrator-provided files** (will be replaced by the plugin):\n\n- .claude/agents/coder.md\n- .claude/agents/code-reviewer.md\n- .claude/skills/implement/SKILL.md\n- .claude/skills/coding-rules/SKILL.md\n- .claude/commands/implement.md\n\n**Project-provided files** (copied from the orchestrator repo as templates):\n\n- .claude/orchestrator-config.yaml\n- .claude/plans/sample-plan.yaml\n- CODING-RULES.md (at project root)\n\n**Your project-specific files** (created by you, must be preserved):\n\n- .claude/orchestrator-config.yaml (if you customized it)\n- .claude/plans/*.yaml (your implementation plans)\n- docs/plans/*.md (your design documents)\n- CODING-RULES.md (if you customized it for your project)\n\n### Step 3: Remove Orchestrator-Provided Files\n\nRemove the files that the plugin will provide. Keep your project-specific files:\n\n```bash\nrm .claude/agents/coder.md\nrm .claude/agents/code-reviewer.md\nrm .claude/skills/implement/SKILL.md\nrm .claude/skills/coding-rules/SKILL.md\nrm .claude/commands/implement.md\n```\n\nAlso remove the copied scripts directory if you had one:\n\n```bash\nrm -rf scripts/plan-orchestrator.py scripts/auto-pipeline.py\n```\n\nDo NOT remove:\n\n- .claude/orchestrator-config.yaml\n- .claude/plans/ (your plans)\n- docs/ (your design documents)\n- CODING-RULES.md (if you customized it)\n\n### Step 4: Install the Plugin\n\n```bash\nclaude plugin install martinbechard/claude-plan-orchestrator\n```\n\nThis installs the orchestrator as a plugin. Claude Code will automatically\ndiscover the agents, skills, and commands from the plugin directory.\n\n### Step 5: Verify the Plugin Is Active\n\nStart Claude Code and verify:\n\n1. The /implement command is available\n2. The coder and code-reviewer agents are listed\n3. The coding-rules and implement skills are available\n\nYou can also check installed plugins:\n\n```bash\nclaude plugin list\n```\n\n### Step 6: Test With an Existing Plan\n\nRun a dry-run of one of your existing plans to confirm everything works:\n\n```bash\npython3 \"$(claude plugin path plan-orchestrator)/scripts/plan-orchestrator.py\" \\\n  --plan .claude/plans/your-plan.yaml --dry-run\n```\n\n---\n\n## What Stays the Same\n\nAfter migrating to the plugin, the following are unchanged:\n\n- **YAML plan format** -- your existing .yaml plan files work without modification\n- **Design document structure** -- docs/plans/*.md files are unchanged\n- **/implement command** -- same command, same behavior\n- **orchestrator-config.yaml** -- same location (.claude/), same format\n- **Agent behavior** -- the coder and code-reviewer agents work identically\n- **CODING-RULES.md** -- your project-level customizations are preserved\n\n---\n\n## Accessing Scripts After Plugin Install\n\nWith the manual-copy workflow, scripts lived in your project's scripts/ directory.\nAfter plugin install, they live in the plugin directory.\n\n### Finding the Plugin Directory\n\n```bash\nclaude plugin path plan-orchestrator\n```\n\nThis prints the absolute path to the plugin directory.\n\n### Running plan-orchestrator.py\n\n```bash\npython3 \"$(claude plugin path plan-orchestrator)/scripts/plan-orchestrator.py\" \\\n  --plan .claude/plans/your-plan.yaml\n```\n\n### Running auto-pipeline.py\n\n```bash\npython3 \"$(claude plugin path plan-orchestrator)/scripts/auto-pipeline.py\" \\\n  --config .claude/orchestrator-config.yaml\n```\n\nYou can create a shell alias for convenience:\n\n```bash\nalias plan-orchestrator='python3 \"$(claude plugin path plan-orchestrator)/scripts/plan-orchestrator.py\"'\nalias auto-pipeline='python3 \"$(claude plugin path plan-orchestrator)/scripts/auto-pipeline.py\"'\n```\n\n---\n\n## Rollback\n\nIf you need to go back to the manual-copy workflow:\n\n### Step 1: Uninstall the Plugin\n\n```bash\nclaude plugin uninstall plan-orchestrator\n```\n\n### Step 2: Restore From Backup\n\nIf you kept your backup:\n\n```bash\ncp -r .claude-backup/* .claude/\n```\n\n### Step 3: Or Re-Copy From the Repository\n\nClone the orchestrator repository and copy the files back:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/martinbechard/claude-plan-orchestrator.git /tmp/orchestrator\n\ncp /tmp/orchestrator/.claude/agents/*.md .claude/agents/\ncp /tmp/orchestrator/.claude/skills/implement/SKILL.md .claude/skills/implement/\ncp /tmp/orchestrator/.claude/skills/coding-rules/SKILL.md .claude/skills/coding-rules/\ncp /tmp/orchestrator/.claude/commands/implement.md .claude/commands/\ncp /tmp/orchestrator/scripts/plan-orchestrator.py scripts/\ncp /tmp/orchestrator/scripts/auto-pipeline.py scripts/\n\nrm -rf /tmp/orchestrator\n```\n\nYour project-specific files (orchestrator-config.yaml, plans, design docs)\nare unaffected by either installation method.\n","numLines":211,"startLine":1,"totalLines":211}}}

For each item: Claude creates a design + YAML plan, then the orchestrator executes it\n   310→4. For defects: runs an independent verification step to confirm symptoms are resolved\n   311→5. If verification fails: deletes stale plan, retries with findings (up to 3 cycles)\n   312→6. Archives completed items to `completed/` subdirectories\n   313→7.

The orchestrator solves this by giving each task a fresh Claude session with:\n- Clean context focused on ONE task\n- The full plan available for reference\n- Automatic status tracking and commits\n\nSee [docs/narrative/](docs/narrative/) for the full development history and design rationale.\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Python 3.8+\n- PyYAML (`pip install pyyaml`)\n- Claude Code CLI installed and authenticated\n- Git (for version control and parallel worktrees)\n- Optional: `watchdog` (`pip install watchdog`) for auto-pipeline\n\n## Installation\n\n### Plugin Install (Recommended)\n\n```bash\nclaude plugin install martinbechard/claude-plan-orchestrator\n```\n\nOr for local development:\n\n```bash\nclaude --plugin-dir /path/to/claude-plan-orchestrator\n```\n\nAfter plugin install, the orchestrator scripts are available in the plugin directory:\n\n```bash\npython \"$(claude plugin path plan-orchestrator)/scripts/plan-orchestrator.py\" --plan .claude/plans/my-feature.yaml\n```\n\nSee [Migration Guide](docs/migration-from-manual-copy.md) for migrating from manual-copy to plugin installation.\n\n### Manual Install (Alternative)\n\nCopy the orchestrator components to your project:\n\n```bash\n# Clone this repo\ngit clone https://github.com/martinbechard/claude-plan-orchestrator.git\n\n# Copy to your project\ncp -r claude-plan-orchestrator/.claude/ /path/to/your/project/\ncp -r claude-plan-orchestrator/scripts/ /path/to/your/project/\ncp -r claude-plan-orchestrator/docs/ /path/to/your/project/\n```\n\nOr copy individual files:\n\n```bash\n# Required\ncp scripts/plan-orchestrator.py /your/project/scripts/\n\n# Recommended\ncp CODING-RULES.md /your/project/                  # Coding standards template\ncp .claude/skills/implement/SKILL.md /your/project/.claude/skills/implement/\n\n# Optional\ncp scripts/auto-pipeline.py /your/project/scripts/\ncp .claude/commands/implement.md /your/project/.claude/commands/\ncp .claude/plans/sample-plan.yaml /your/project/.claude/plans/\n```\n\n## Quick Start\n\n### 1. Create your plan\n\n```bash\ncp .claude/plans/sample-plan.yaml .claude/plans/my-feature.yaml\n```\n\nEdit the plan with your tasks:\n\n```yaml\nmeta:\n  name: My Feature\n  description: What this plan accomplishes\n  plan_doc: docs/plans/2026-01-20-my-feature-design.md\n  created: '2026-01-20'\n  max_attempts_default: 3\n\nsections:\n- id: phase-1\n  name: Phase 1 - Setup\n  status: pending\n  tasks:\n  - id: '1.1'\n    name: Create initial structure\n    status: pending\n    description: Set up the basic project structure\n  - id: '1.2'\n    name: Add configuration\n    status: pending\n    description: Add configuration files\n    depends_on:\n    - '1.1'\n\n- id: phase-2\n  name: Phase 2 - Implementation (Parallel)\n  status: pending\n  tasks:\n  - id: '2.1'\n    name: Build component A\n    status: pending\n    description: Implement component A\n    parallel_group: phase-2-impl\n    depends_on:\n    - '1.2'\n  - id: '2.2'\n    name: Build component B\n    status: pending\n    description: Implement component B\n    parallel_group: phase-2-impl\n    depends_on:\n    - '1.2'\n```\n\n### 2. Create your design document\n\nWrite detailed implementation steps at `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-my-feature-design.md`. The more detailed, the better Claude will execute each task.\n\n### 3. Run the orchestrator\n\n```bash\n# Dry run first (shows what would execute)\npython scripts/plan-orchestrator.py --plan .claude/plans/my-feature.yaml --dry-run\n\n# Run all pending tasks\npython scripts/plan-orchestrator.py --plan .claude/plans/my-feature.yaml\n\n# Run with parallel execution\npython scripts/plan-orchestrator.py --plan .claude/plans/my-feature.yaml --parallel\n\n# Run single task then stop\npython scripts/plan-orchestrator.py --plan .claude/plans/my-feature.yaml --single-task\n\n# Resume from specific task\npython scripts/plan-orchestrator.py --plan .claude/plans/my-feature.yaml --resume-from 2.1\n\n# Verbose output with real-time streaming\npython scripts/plan-orchestrator.py --plan .claude/plans/my-feature.yaml --verbose\n\n# Skip post-plan smoke tests\npython scripts/plan-orchestrator.py --plan .claude/plans/my-feature.yaml --skip-smoke\n```\n\n## Features\n\n### Parallel Execution\n\nTasks with the same `parallel_group` run concurrently in isolated git worktrees:\n\n```yaml\n- id: '2.1'\n  parallel_group: phase-2-impl    # Same group = run in parallel\n  depends_on: ['1.2']\n- id: '2.2'\n  parallel_group: phase-2-impl    # Same group = run in parallel\n  depends_on: ['1.2']\n- id: '2.3'\n  exclusive_resources: [database]  # Can't share = run sequentially\n  depends_on: ['1.2']\n```\n\nEach parallel task:\n- Runs in its own git worktree (isolated working directory)\n- Follows a subagent coordination protocol (file claims, heartbeats)\n- Has artifacts merged back via file-copy (not git merge, to avoid YAML conflicts)\n\n### Dependency Management\n\nTasks declare dependencies with `depends_on`. The orchestrator only starts a task when all its dependencies are completed:\n\n```yaml\n- id: '3.1'\n  depends_on:\n  - '2.1'\n  - '2.2'\n  - '2.3'\n```\n\n### Circuit Breaker\n\nAfter 3 consecutive task failures (configurable), the orchestrator pauses for 300 seconds before retrying. This prevents burning through rate limits or repeatedly hitting the same error.\n\n### Rate Limit Detection\n\nWhen Claude CLI output contains rate limit messages (\"You've hit your limit\"), the orchestrator:\n1. Parses the reset time from the message\n2. Calculates wait duration with timezone awareness\n3. Sleeps until reset + 30s buffer\n4. Resumes execution automatically\n\n### Graceful Stop\n\nTo stop the orchestrator between tasks without killing it:\n\n```bash\ntouch .claude/plans/.stop\n```\n\nThe orchestrator checks for this semaphore before each new task and exits cleanly. Remove it to allow future runs.\n\n### Post-Plan Smoke Tests\n\nAfter all tasks complete, the orchestrator can run Playwright smoke tests to verify the application still works:\n\n```bash\n# Enabled by default (looks for tests/SMOKE01-critical-paths.spec.ts)\npython scripts/plan-orchestrator.py --plan .claude/plans/my-feature.yaml\n\n# Disable smoke tests\npython scripts/plan-orchestrator.py --plan .claude/plans/my-feature.yaml --skip-smoke\n```\n\n### Plan Modification by Claude\n\nClaude can modify the YAML plan during execution:\n- **Split tasks**: Large task 2.1 becomes 2.1a, 2.1b, 2.1c\n- **Add tasks**: Insert discovered work\n- **Skip tasks**: Mark unnecessary tasks as skipped\n- **Self-extending plans**: A task can append new tasks and set `plan_modified: true`\n\nSet `plan_modified: true` in the status file to trigger a plan reload.\n\n### Verbose / Streaming Output\n\nUse `--verbose` for real-time streaming of Claude's output via `--output-format stream-json`:\n\n```bash\npython scripts/plan-orchestrator.py --plan .claude/plans/my-feature.yaml --verbose\n```\n\n## Auto-Pipeline\n\nThe auto-pipeline daemon (`scripts/auto-pipeline.py`) watches backlog folders and drives the orchestrator automatically:\n\n```bash\n# Watch backlogs and process items\npython scripts/auto-pipeline.py\n\n# Single pass (process one item, then exit)\npython scripts/auto-pipeline.py --once\n\n# Dry run\npython scripts/auto-pipeline.py --dry-run\n\n# Verbose output\npython scripts/auto-pipeline.py --verbose\n```\n\nThe auto-pipeline:\n1. Monitors `docs/defect-backlog/` and `docs/feature-backlog/` for new `.md` files\n2. Prioritizes defects over features; respects `## Dependencies` between items\n3. For each item: Claude creates a design + YAML plan, then the orchestrator executes it\n4. For defects: runs an independent verification step to confirm symptoms are resolved\n5. If verification fails: deletes stale plan, retries with findings (up to 3 cycles)\n6. Archives completed items to `completed/` subdirectories\n7. Shares the `.stop` semaphore with the orchestrator for coordinated shutdown\n\nRequires: `pip install watchdog pyyaml`\n\n### Defect Verification Loop\n\nFor defects, the auto-pipeline runs a verify-then-fix cycle after the orchestrator completes:\n\n```\nPhase 1: Create plan      --> Phase 2: Execute plan\n                                        |\n                              Phase 3: Verify symptoms\n                                    |           |\n                                  PASS        FAIL\n                                    |           |\n                              Phase 4:    Delete stale plan,\n                              Archive     loop to Phase 1\n                                          (findings in defect file\n                                           inform the next plan)\n```\n\nThe verifier is a read-only Claude session that checks whether the reported symptoms are actually resolved. It appends structured findings to the defect file, which the next plan-creation step reads to produce a targeted fix.\n\n### Project Configuration\n\nCustomize build and test commands in `.claude/orchestrator-config.yaml`:\n\n```yaml\n# Build/test commands used during verification (defaults shown)\n# build_command: \"pnpm run build\"\n# test_command: \"pnpm test\"\n# dev_server_command: \"pnpm dev\"\n# dev_server_port: 3000\n```\n\n### Backlog Item Format\n\nWrite backlog items as markdown files in `docs/defect-backlog/` or `docs/feature-backlog/`:\n\n```markdown\n# Brief Title\n\n## Status: Open\n\n## Priority: High\n\n## Summary\nWhat this defect/feature is about.\n\n## Expected Behavior\nWhat should happen.\n\n## Actual Behavior\nWhat actually happens (for defects).\n\n## Fix Required\nSpecific steps or criteria for the fix.\n\n## Verification\nHow to verify the fix is correct.\n\n## Dependencies\n- 02-other-feature.md\n```\n\nKey conventions:\n- Filenames use `NN-slug-name.md` format (e.g., `01-fix-login-bug.md`)\n- `## Status: Fixed` or `## Status: Completed` marks items as done (auto-pipeline skips them)\n- `## Dependencies` lists other backlog slugs that must be completed first\n- Items in `completed/` subdirectories are ignored\n- Items in `on-hold/` subdirectories are ignored\n\n## Manual Execution\n\nYou can also run tasks manually using the `/implement` command in Claude Code:\n\n```\n/implement        # Run next pending task\n/implement 2.1    # Run specific task by ID\n```\n\n## How It Works\n\n1. **Find Next Task**: Orchestrator finds first `pending` or `in_progress` task (respecting dependencies)\n2. **Build Prompt**: Creates prompt with task details, plan document reference, and coordination instructions\n3. **Execute Claude**: Runs `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions --print <prompt>` in a fresh session\n4. **Check Status**: Reads `.claude/plans/task-status.json` for result\n5. **Update Plan**: Marks task complete/failed in YAML\n6. **Commit**: Auto-commits changes to git\n7. **Repeat**: Continues until all tasks done, circuit breaker trips, or stop semaphore detected\n\n### Status File Protocol\n\nClaude writes its status to `.claude/plans/task-status.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"task_id\": \"1.1\",\n  \"status\": \"completed\",\n  \"message\": \"What was accomplished\",\n  \"timestamp\": \"2026-01-20T12:00:00Z\",\n  \"plan_modified\": false\n}\n```\n\n### Task Statuses\n\n- `pending` - Not yet started\n- `in_progress` - Currently being executed\n- `completed` - Successfully finished\n- `failed` - Failed after max attempts\n- `skipped` - Manually skipped with reason\n\n## Subagent Coordination Protocol\n\nWhen running parallel tasks, each Claude session follows a coordination protocol:\n\n1. **File Claims**: Before editing a file, check/claim it in `.claude/agent-claims.json`\n2. **Heartbeats**: Update `.claude/subagent-status/{agent-id}.json` periodically\n3. **Conflict Detection**: The orchestrator checks for file conflicts before spawning parallel tasks\n4. **Stale Claim Cleanup**: Heartbeat-based detection of abandoned claims\n\nSee `.claude/skills/implement/SKILL.md` for the full protocol details.\n\n## Directory Structure\n\n```\nyour-project/\n├── CODING-RULES.md                   # Coding standards (adapt for your project)\n├── .claude/\n│   ├── plans/\n│   │   ├── sample-plan.yaml        # Template plan\n│   │   ├── my-feature.yaml         # Your active plan\n│   │   ├── task-status.json        # Auto-generated status\n│   │   └── .stop                   # Graceful stop semaphore\n│   ├── skills/\n│   │   └── implement/\n│   │       └── SKILL.md            # Implementation skill\n│   ├── commands/\n│   │   └── implement.md            # /implement command\n│   ├── subagent-status/            # Parallel task heartbeats\n│   └── agent-claims.json           # File claim coordination\n├── scripts/\n│   ├── plan-orchestrator.py        # Main orchestrator (~2095 lines)\n│   └── auto-pipeline.py            # Auto-pipeline daemon (~1450 lines)\n└── docs/\n    ├── plans/\n    │   └── YYYY-MM-DD-*.md         # Design documents\n    └── narrative/\n        └── *.md                    # Development history\n```\n\n## Tips\n\n1. **Start Small**: Test with 2-3 tasks before running large plans\n2. **Detailed Designs**: The design doc is crucial - be specific about file paths and steps\n3. **Use Dependencies**: Declare `depends_on` to ensure correct execution order\n4. **Parallel Where Possible**: Group independent tasks with `parallel_group` for faster execution\n5. **Graceful Stop**: Use `touch .claude/plans/.stop` instead of killing the process\n6. **Self-Extending Plans**: Let Claude add tasks during execution with `plan_modified: true`\n7. **Monitor Progress**: Check the YAML file for status updates during execution\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n**Task keeps failing:**\n- Check the error message in `last_error` field\n- Increase `max_attempts` for complex tasks (default: 3, max recommended: 5)\n- Simplify the task description\n- The circuit breaker trips after 3 consecutive failures (300s cooldown)\n\n**Parallel tasks conflict:**\n- Use `exclusive_resources` to prevent shared-resource tasks from running together\n- The conflict detector checks file paths in task descriptions before spawning\n\n**Rate limit hit:**\n- The orchestrator auto-detects and waits for rate limit reset\n- Check the output for \"Rate limit detected\" messages\n\n**Claude doesn't write status file:**\n- Ensure the implement skill is in `.claude/skills/implement/SKILL.md`\n- Check Claude has write access to `.claude/plans/`\n\n**Graceful stop not working:**\n- Ensure the `.stop` file is in `.claude/plans/.stop` (not the project root)\n- The check happens before each new task, not during execution\n\n**Stale worktrees after crash:**\n- Run `git worktree list` and `git worktree remove <path>` for orphans\n- The orchestrator attempts cleanup, but crashes may leave worktrees behind\n\n## Development History\n\nThe orchestrator evolved from a 454-line sequential executor to a ~3500-line parallel execution engine (across two scripts) over the course of building a production application. See [docs/narrative/](docs/narrative/) for the complete development history, including:\n\n- Genesis and initial design decisions\n- Parallel execution via git worktrees\n- Subagent coordination protocol\n- Hardening (graceful stop, binary resolution, stale branch cleanup)\n- Rate limit detection and resilience\n- Smoke tests and streaming output\n- Auto-pipeline daemon\n- Lessons learned and open questions\n- Fixing the parallel merge strategy\n- Design competitions: parallel design generation with AI judge\n- Verification loop: independent symptom verification for defects\n\n## License\n\nMIT License - see [LICENSE](LICENSE)\n","numLines":522,"startLine":1,"totalLines":522}}}
