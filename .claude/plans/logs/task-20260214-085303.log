{"type":"user","message":{"role":"user","content":[{"type":"text","text":"Base directory for this skill: /Users/martinbechard/dev/claude-plan-orchestrator/.claude/skills/coding-rules\n\n# Coding Rules (Summary)\n\nThis skill provides a condensed overview of the project's coding standards. Each section\nbelow summarizes a rule category. For the full rules with rationale (the BECAUSE chains)\nand examples, read **CODING-RULES.md** at the project root.\n\n## Rule 0: File Headers and Design Traceability\n\nEvery source file must include a header comment with the file path, a one-line purpose\nsummary, and a reference to the relevant design document. Before modifying code, verify\nchanges against the design document referenced in the header. Design documents are the\nsingle source of truth for module behavior; keep them synchronized with the code.\n\n## Rule 1: Naming Conventions\n\nUse PascalCase for classes, interfaces, types, and React components. Use camelCase for\nvariables, functions, methods, and utility files. Use ALL_CAPS_SNAKE_CASE for manifest\nconstants. Use kebab-case for configuration files. File names must match their primary\nclass or component. Names must be clear, descriptive, and follow Command-Query Separation\n(nouns for queries, verbs for mutations).\n\n## Rule 2: File Organization and Imports\n\nOrganize files into standard directories (src/, scripts/, docs/, tests/). Separate shared\ncontracts (interfaces, types, constants) from implementation. Files exceeding 200 lines\nshould be refactored into a module folder with an entry point that exports only the public\nAPI. Entry points must contain only import/export statements. Organize imports as: external\nlibraries, project aliases, relative imports. Remove unused imports. Avoid circular\ndependencies.\n\n## Rule 3: Code Structure and Readability\n\nMethods should not exceed 30-40 lines; extract complex logic into helpers. Classes should\nnot exceed 300 lines. Functions with more than two parameters must use a parameter object.\nPrioritize code clarity over premature abstraction. Focus on minimal, necessary changes;\navoid over-engineering.\n\n## Rule 4: Type Safety\n\nNever use the any type; create proper typed interfaces. Use interface for contracts, type\nfor data shapes and unions, class when behavior or state is required. Avoid primitive\nobsession; use domain-specific types. Never use literal magic numbers or strings; define\nmanifest constants at the top of the file or in a constants module.\n\n## Rule 5: Coupling and Cohesion\n\nClasses must have a single responsibility (SRP). Methods must perform a single logical\noperation. Depend on interfaces rather than concrete implementations. Do not access private\nmembers of other classes. Avoid Feature Envy (move methods to where the data lives).\nUtility functions used by only one class should be private to that class.\n\n## Rule 6: Error Handling\n\nNever use empty catch blocks; always log or re-throw. Do not use exceptions for control\nflow. Provide clear error messages with context (what was attempted, which values were\ninvolved). Include variable names alongside values in log statements.\n\n## Rule 7: Comments and Documentation\n\nEvery exported symbol must have a doc comment explaining its purpose. Write comments to\nexplain why, not what. Remove commented-out code (use version control). Keep comments\naccurate and up-to-date. Avoid excessive comments; refactor for clarity instead. Remove\nTODO/FIXME comments before task completion; use the YAML plan to track remaining work.\n\n## Rule 11: Test Discipline\n\nRun related tests after any code change. Failing tests are your responsibility; fix them\nimmediately. TypeScript errors in test files count as broken tests. When splitting large\ntest suites, migrate incrementally (one group at a time, verify, continue).\n\n## Rule 12: AI-Specific Discipline\n\nNever remove existing functionality when asked to simplify. Do not add features or\nimprovements beyond what was asked. Show actual state honestly (null, empty, not configured);\nnever invent fallback data. Never defer work because a file is too large; split and\nintegrate immediately.

Your job is to create detailed architecture\ndesigns for Phase 0 design competitions. You produce design documents, NOT code.\nYou analyze existing code to inform your designs but never modify files.\n\n## Before Designing\n\nComplete this checklist before starting your design:\n\n1. Read the competition brief / task description thoroughly\n2. Read existing source code in the areas the feature will touch\n3. Identify existing patterns, data models, and API boundaries\n4. Read the design document referenced in the task (if any)\n\n## Design Output Structure\n\nYour design document must include these sections:\n\n- **Architecture Overview:** High-level component diagram (ASCII). Show the major\n  modules, their responsibilities, and how data flows between them.\n- **Data Models:** TypeScript interfaces for all new data shapes. Follow existing\n  naming conventions (PascalCase for types, camelCase for fields).\n- **Component Hierarchy:** Parent-child relationships and props flow. Show which\n  components own state and which receive it.\n- **API Boundaries:** Endpoints, request/response shapes, and error cases. Define\n  the contract between modules clearly.\n- **Integration Points:** How new code connects to existing modules. Identify\n  imports, shared types, and extension points.\n- **Trade-off Analysis:** Alternatives considered with pros/cons of the chosen\n  approach. Explain why the selected design wins.\n- **Scalability Considerations:** How the design handles growth in data volume,\n  user count, or feature scope without requiring redesign.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nThese are the criteria the judge uses to score your design:\n\n- **Scalability (0-10):** Handles growth without requiring redesign\n- **Maintainability (0-10):** Clear separation of concerns, testable units\n- **Integration (0-10):** Fits existing codebase patterns and conventions\n- **Completeness (0-10):** All requirements from the competition brief addressed\n- **Feasibility (0-10):** Implementable within project constraints and timeline\n\n## Constraints\n\n- You are READ-ONLY. Never use Write, Edit, or Bash tools to modify files.\n- Only use Read, Grep, and Glob to inspect the codebase.\n- Write your design document to the OUTPUT path specified in the task description.\n- Use ASCII diagrams for all visual representations, not images.\n- Base every design decision on evidence from the existing codebase.\n\n## Output Protocol\n\nWhen your design is complete, write a status file to .claude/plans/task-status.json:\n\n    {\n      \"task_id\": \"<the task id>\",\n      \"status\": \"completed\",\n      \"message\": \"Brief description of the design produced\",\n      \"timestamp\": \"<ISO 8601 timestamp>\",\n      \"plan_modified\": false\n    }\n\nIf the design cannot be completed (e.g., competition brief missing or unclear),\nset status to \"failed\" with a clear message explaining what went wrong.\n","numLines":81,"startLine":1,"totalLines":81}}}

Your job is to read a winning design from a\nPhase 0 competition and translate it into concrete YAML implementation phases\nthat the orchestrator can execute.

Read the judge's feedback and scoring (if available)\n3. Read the existing YAML plan to understand current structure\n4. Read the project's coding rules (CODING-RULES.md or equivalent)\n5. Identify which files need to be created vs. modified\n\n## Plan Output Structure\n\nAppend new sections to the YAML plan with:\n\n- **Section IDs:** Continue from the last existing section ID. If the last section\n  is \"phase-2\", your first new section is \"phase-3\".\n- **Task IDs:** Continue from the last existing task ID.

Assign other agents only when the task specifically requires\n  their capabilities.\n- **Dependencies:** Use depends_on to express build order between tasks. Earlier\n  tasks that produce files needed by later tasks must be listed as dependencies.\n- **Parallel Groups:** Assign parallel_group to independent tasks that can run\n  concurrently.

If a task seems too large, split it into subtasks.\n- **Specific File Paths:** Task descriptions must include the exact file paths to\n  create or modify. Never leave the implementer guessing which files to touch.\n- **Valid DAG:** Dependencies must form a directed acyclic graph. No circular\n  dependencies allowed.\n- **Build Order:** Follow the docs -> code -> tests -> verification order within\n  each section. Create interfaces before implementations, implementations before\n  tests.\n- **Reference Lines:** When modifying existing files, reference approximate line\n  numbers or surrounding code landmarks to help the implementer locate the right\n  section.\n\n## Constraints\n\n- Use the Write tool to modify the YAML plan file. Read the current plan first,\n  then write the updated version.\n- Set plan_modified: true in the status file so the orchestrator reloads the plan.\n- Do NOT implement any code.
