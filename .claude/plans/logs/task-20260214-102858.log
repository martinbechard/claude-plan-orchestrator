The commit output confirms \"100% similarity\" renames, meaning `git log --follow <new-path>` will still show the full history of each file.\n- **Untracked file handling:** The file `08-fix-in-progress-confusion.md` was untracked (it appeared as `??` in git status), so `git mv` would have failed. The solution was to use a regular `mv` followed by `git add`, which adds it as a new file at the destination.\n- **Empty directory cleanup:** Git doesn't track empty directories, so once all files were moved out of `docs/defect-backlog/completed/` and `docs/feature-backlog/completed/`, a simple `rmdir` cleaned them up. No git operation needed for the directory removal itself.\n`─────────────────────────────────────────────────`\n\nTask 1.2 is complete. Summary of what was done:\n\n1. Created `docs/completed-backlog/defects/` and `docs/completed-backlog/features/`\n2. Moved 1 defect file (`01-hardcoded-pnpm-in-verification-prompt.md`) to `docs/completed-backlog/defects/`\n3. Moved 7 feature files (`02` through `08`) to `docs/completed-backlog/features/`\n4. Removed the now-empty `docs/defect-backlog/completed/` and `docs/feature-backlog/completed/` directories\n5. Verified all files are in the correct locations and old directories are gone\n6.
