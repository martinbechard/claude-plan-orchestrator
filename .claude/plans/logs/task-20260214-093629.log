Modify run_claude_task() to always use structured JSON output from the Claude CLI, parse the result event, and populate TaskUsage on every TaskResult. Add a PlanUsageTracker to accumulate per-task usage into section-level and plan-level totals. Write a usage-report.json alongside plan logs when the plan completes. Enhance per-task log files with usage data.\n\n**Tech Stack:** Python 3 (plan-orchestrator.py, auto-pipeline.py), JSON (CLI output parsing, usage report), YAML (plan files)\n\n---\n\n## Architecture Overview\n\n### TaskUsage Dataclass\n\nNew dataclass added alongside TaskResult in plan-orchestrator.py:\n\n    @dataclass\n    class TaskUsage:\n        input_tokens: int = 0\n        output_tokens: int = 0\n        cache_read_tokens: int = 0\n        cache_creation_tokens: int = 0\n        total_cost_usd: float = 0.0\n        num_turns: int = 0\n        duration_api_ms: int = 0\n\nTaskResult gets an optional field:\n\n    usage: Optional[TaskUsage] = None\n\n### CLI Output Capture Strategy\n\nThe Claude CLI provides full usage data in its JSON output. Currently the orchestrator only uses structured output in verbose mode (--output-format stream-json). In non-verbose mode it uses plain text, which discards usage data.\n\n**Non-verbose mode change:** Add --output-format json to the CLI command. After the process completes, parse the final stdout as JSON to extract the result object containing usage fields. The \"progress dots\" display remains unchanged because dots are driven by byte counts, not by parsing stdout content.\n\n**Verbose mode change:** Modify stream_json_output() to capture and return the result event data. Currently it parses the result event (line 1803) and prints cost/duration/turns, but discards the data. Change: pass a mutable dict into the function; when the result event arrives, store it there. After the thread joins, run_claude_task() reads the dict.\n\n**Both paths produce a TaskUsage** that is attached to the returned TaskResult.\n\n### Usage Extraction\n\nFrom the CLI result JSON:\n\n    input_tokens = result.get(\"usage\", {}).get(\"input_tokens\", 0)\n    output_tokens = result.get(\"usage\", {}).get(\"output_tokens\", 0)\n    cache_read_tokens = result.get(\"usage\", {}).get(\"cache_read_input_tokens\", 0)\n    cache_creation_tokens = result.get(\"usage\", {}).get(\"cache_creation_input_tokens\", 0)\n    total_cost_usd = result.get(\"total_cost_usd\", 0.0)\n    num_turns = result.get(\"num_turns\", 0)","numLines":50,"startLine":1,"totalLines":190}}}
