It:\n1. Reads the plan to find the next uncompleted task\n2. Reads relevant architecture and design documents\n3. Implements the changes following project coding rules\n4. Runs tests and build to verify\n5. Writes a status file for the orchestrator\n6. Commits changes after completion\n7. Marks the task as complete in the plan\n\n## Usage\n\nInvoke with: `/implement` or `/implement [task id]`\n\n## YAML Plans\n\nYAML plans live in `.claude/plans/` and are executed by `scripts/plan-orchestrator.py`.\n\n**To run automated execution:**\n\nIMPORTANT: Always launch the orchestrator as a background Bash task using `run_in_background: true`\nso it appears in the Claude Code task list. Then monitor it periodically by checking the YAML plan\nfor task status updates. Never launch with shell `&` --- it won't be tracked.\n\n```bash\n# Run all pending tasks sequentially (use run_in_background: true)\npython scripts/plan-orchestrator.py --plan .claude/plans/<plan-name>.yaml\n\n# Run with parallel task execution (uses git worktrees)\npython scripts/plan-orchestrator.py --plan .claude/plans/<plan-name>.yaml --parallel\n\n# Run single task then stop\npython scripts/plan-orchestrator.py --plan .claude/plans/<plan-name>.yaml --single-task\n\n# Resume from specific task\npython scripts/plan-orchestrator.py --plan .claude/plans/<plan-name>.yaml --resume-from 4.7\n\n# Dry run to preview execution order\npython scripts/plan-orchestrator.py --plan .claude/plans/<plan-name>.yaml --dry-run\n\n# Verbose with real-time streaming\npython scripts/plan-orchestrator.py --plan .claude/plans/<plan-name>.yaml --verbose\n```\n\n**Monitoring the Orchestrator:**\n\nAfter launching the orchestrator in the background, check on progress periodically:\n\n```bash\n# Quick status: show non-completed tasks\ngrep -E '(status:|id:)' .claude/plans/<plan>.yaml | paste - - | grep -v completed\n\n# Check if orchestrator process is alive\npgrep -f \"plan-orchestrator\"\n\n# Check child Claude processes\npgrep -P <orchestrator-pid>\n\n# Check current task status file\ncat .claude/plans/task-status.json\n```\n\nCheck every 2-3 minutes during active execution. Report progress to the user when tasks\ncomplete or if the orchestrator encounters errors (circuit breaker, rate limits, failures).\n\n**Graceful Stop:**\nTo stop the orchestrator without killing the current task, create a semaphore file:\n```bash\ntouch .claude/plans/.stop\n```\nThe orchestrator checks for this file before starting each new task. The current task\nwill finish normally, then the orchestrator will exit cleanly. The semaphore file is\nautomatically cleaned up on the next orchestrator start, so a stale file from a\nprevious run will not block a new run.\n\n**YAML Plan Structure:**\n```yaml\nmeta:\n  name: Feature Name\n  description: What this plan accomplishes\n  plan_doc: docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-feature-design.md\n  created: 'YYYY-MM-DD'\n  max_attempts_default: 3\n  notification_email: user@example.com\nsections:\n- id: phase-1\n  name: Phase Name\n  status: pending  # pending | in_progress | completed | failed\n  tasks:\n  - id: '1.1'\n    name: Task Name\n    status: pending\n    description: What this task does\n    depends_on: ['0.4']           # optional, task IDs that must complete first\n    parallel_group: 'group-name'  # optional, tasks with same group run in parallel\n    exclusive_resources:           # optional, prevents parallel with same resource\n    - database\n    max_attempts: 3               # optional, overrides default\n    execution_mode: agent_team    # optional, use agent team for this task\n    team_roles:                   # optional, roles for agent team\n    - name: role-name\n      focus: \"What this role does\"\n```\n\n**Task Fields:**\n- `id` - Unique identifier (e.g., '1.1', '2.3a')\n- `name` - Short task name\n- `status` - pending | in_progress | completed | failed | skipped\n- `description` - Detailed description (include \"Files:\" for conflict detection)\n- `depends_on` - List of task IDs that must complete before this task can start\n- `parallel_group` - Tasks with the same group execute concurrently (requires `--parallel`)\n- `exclusive_resources` - Resources that can't be shared (e.g., ['database', 'config'])\n- `max_attempts` - Override default retry count\n- `execution_mode` - Set to `agent_team` for collaborative tasks\n- `team_roles` - Define roles when using agent team execution\n\n## Choosing Task Execution Strategy\n\nThe orchestrator drives execution. When designing a YAML plan, decide the execution\nstrategy for each task based on whether agents need to communicate:\n\n| Strategy | YAML Config | When to Use |\n|----------|-------------|-------------|\n| Single agent (default) | No special fields | Most tasks: one agent, one focused job |\n| Independent parallel | `parallel_group` | Tasks touch different files, no coordination needed |\n| Design competition | `parallel_group` + judge task | Multiple approaches to evaluate (see below) |\n| Agent team | `execution_mode: agent_team` | Tasks require inter-agent discussion and collaboration |\n\n**Decision guide for each task in the plan:**\n1. Can this task be done by one agent in isolation? -> Single agent (default)\n2. Can multiple tasks run at the same time without talking to each other? -> `parallel_group`\n3. Are there multiple valid approaches that should be explored? -> Design competition\n4. Do agents need to discuss interfaces, challenge assumptions, or coordinate? -> Agent team\n\n## Parallel Execution\n\nWhen `--parallel` is enabled, tasks with the same `parallel_group` field execute concurrently:\n- Each parallel task runs in its own git worktree (`.worktrees/` directory)\n- Results are merged back to main branch after all parallel tasks complete\n- The orchestrator automatically detects file conflicts from task descriptions\n- Tasks with conflicts fall back to sequential execution\n\n**Parallel Coordination (Automatic):**\nThe orchestrator extracts file paths from task descriptions and validates that parallel\ntasks don't conflict:\n- Files mentioned after \"Files:\" or \"New:\" are tracked\n- Paths matching patterns like `src/.../*.tsx` are detected\n- If two tasks in the same `parallel_group` modify the same file, they run sequentially\n\n**Exclusive Resources:**\nFor non-file resources that can't be shared (e.g., database schemas, global state):\n```yaml\n- id: '2.1'\n  name: Run database migration\n  parallel_group: 'phase-2'\n  exclusive_resources: ['database', 'prisma-schema']\n```\nTasks declaring the same exclusive resource cannot run in parallel.\n\n**Writing Good Task Descriptions for Parallel Execution:**\nInclude file paths in descriptions to enable automatic conflict detection:\n```yaml\ndescription: |\n  Add user search to the assignment panel.\n  Files: src/components/community/UserAssignments.tsx\n  New: src/components/community/UserSearchInput.tsx\n```\n\n## Design Competitions (Phase 0 Pattern)\n\nFor features with multiple valid approaches (especially UI), use the design competition\npattern. Five parallel agents each explore a different approach, then a judge picks the best:\n\n```yaml\n- id: phase-0\n  name: 'Phase 0: Design Generation & Evaluation'\n  tasks:\n  - id: '0.1'\n    name: Generate Design 1 - Approach A\n    parallel_group: phase-0-designs\n    description: |\n      Create a detailed design using approach A.\n      CONTEXT: [key source files, design overview with eval criteria]\n      DESIGN CONCEPT: [unique visual/architectural approach]\n      OUTPUT: Write ONLY to docs/plans/feature-design-1-approach-a.md\n  - id: '0.2'\n    name: Generate Design 2 - Approach B\n    parallel_group: phase-0-designs\n    # ... same context, different concept, different output file\n  # ... designs 3, 4, 5\n  - id: '0.6'\n    name: Judge and select best design\n    depends_on: ['0.1', '0.2', '0.3', '0.4', '0.5']\n    description: |\n      Read all 5 designs. Score each on 5 criteria (10 pts each, 50 total).\n      Declare winner. List 2-3 improvements from runner-ups to incorporate.\n      Update the design overview doc with scoring table and final design.\n  - id: '0.7'\n    name: Extend plan with implementation tasks\n    depends_on: ['0.6']\n    description: |\n      Read winning design. Append implementation phases to THIS YAML.\n      Set plan_modified: true in status file so orchestrator reloads.\n```\n\nThe AI judge validates the design; no human review is needed. The human only intervenes\nif the circuit breaker trips or smoke tests fail during implementation.\n\n## Agent Teams (Collaborative Tasks)\n\nAgent teams let multiple Claude Code instances communicate with each other via messages\nwhile sharing a task list. The orchestrator spawns the team; agents collaborate in real-time.\n\n**Agent teams are the right choice when:**\n- Tasks touch related or overlapping code and agents need to coordinate interfaces\n- Debugging requires competing hypotheses that agents should discuss and challenge\n- Cross-layer changes span frontend, backend, and tests with interface contracts to agree on\n- Design reviews benefit from agents critiquing each other's approaches\n- Code review needs multiple focused perspectives (security, performance, test coverage)\n\n**Agent teams are NOT the right choice when:**\n- Tasks are fully independent (use `parallel_group` instead)\n- Only the result matters, not the process (use subagents instead)\n- Tasks are sequential with dependencies (use orchestrator sequential)\n- The work is simple enough for a single agent session\n\n**How agent teams work:**\n1. The orchestrator (or lead session) creates the team with `TeamCreate`\n2. Teammates are spawned via `Task` tool with `team_name` and `name` parameters\n3. Teammates communicate via `SendMessage` (direct messages or broadcast)\n4. All agents share a task list (`TaskCreate`, `TaskList`, `TaskUpdate`)\n5. Teammates self-claim unblocked tasks or the lead assigns them\n6. When done, the lead sends `shutdown_request` to each teammate, then `TeamDelete`\n\n**Configuring agent team tasks in YAML plans:**\n\nUse `execution_mode: agent_team` and `team_roles` to define how the orchestrator should\nset up the team for a task:\n```yaml\n- id: '3.1'\n  name: Implement auth middleware + API endpoint + integration test\n  status: pending\n  execution_mode: agent_team\n  team_roles:\n    - name: backend-dev\n      focus: \"Implement auth middleware and service layer\"\n    - name: api-dev\n      focus: \"Implement API endpoint consuming the middleware\"\n    - name: test-dev\n      focus: \"Write integration tests as the API stabilizes\"\n  description: |\n    These tasks are tightly coupled - the API depends on middleware interfaces,\n    and tests depend on both. Use an agent team so agents can discuss interface\n    contracts and unblock each other in real-time.\n```\n\n**Best practices for agent teams:**\n- Give each teammate enough context in their spawn prompt (they don't inherit conversation history)\n- Size tasks appropriately: 5-6 tasks per teammate keeps everyone productive\n- Avoid two teammates editing the same file simultaneously (coordinate via messages)\n- Use `delegate` mode on the lead (Shift+Tab) to prevent it from implementing instead of coordinating\n- Monitor progress and redirect approaches that aren't working\n- Start with research/review teams before attempting parallel implementation teams\n\n**Token cost consideration:**\nAgent teams are the most expensive execution strategy. Each teammate is a full Claude instance.\nUse them when the collaboration value justifies the cost (debugging, cross-layer coordination,\ndesign critiques) and prefer cheaper strategies (parallel_group, single agent) for independent work.\n\n## Workflow for YAML Plans\n\n### Step 1: Check for YAML Plan\n\nLook for active YAML plans in `.claude/plans/`:\n```bash\nls -la .claude/plans/*.yaml\n```\n\n### Step 2: Find Next Task\n\nRead the plan and find the first task with `status: pending` or `status: in_progress`.\n\n### Step 2b: Check Backlog Dependencies\n\nBefore executing, verify the backlog item's dependencies are satisfied:\n1. Identify the plan's backlog slug from the YAML filename (e.g. `02-blog-publishing-system.yaml` -> `02-blog-publishing-system`)\n2. Find the matching `.md` file in `docs/feature-backlog/` or `docs/defect-backlog/`\n3. Parse the `## Dependencies` section for lines matching `NN-slug-name.md`\n4. Check if each dependency slug exists in `docs/feature-backlog/completed/` or `docs/defect-backlog/completed/`\n5. If any are missing, log a visible warning:\n   `WARNING: This plan has unsatisfied backlog dependencies: [list of missing slugs]`\n6. Continue execution (the human/orchestrator decided to run it), but ensure the warning is visible\n\n### Step 3: Read Context\n\nBefore implementing, ALWAYS read:\n1. The project's coding rules: `CODING-RULES.md` (in the project root)\n2. The `plan_doc` referenced in meta - detailed design\n3. Relevant architecture and design documents\n\n### Step 4: Implement Changes\n\n- Follow the project's coding standards\n- Use existing patterns from the codebase\n- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones\n\n### Step 5: Verify Changes\n\nRun the project's build and test commands to verify no errors:\n```bash\n# Example (adapt to your project):\nnpm run build\nnpm test\n```\n\n### Step 6: Write Status File\n\n**CRITICAL**: Write status to `.claude/plans/task-status.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"task_id\": \"4.7\",\n  \"status\": \"completed\",\n  \"message\": \"Brief description of what was done\",\n  \"timestamp\": \"2026-01-19T12:00:00Z\",\n  \"plan_modified\": false\n}\n```\n\nFor failures:\n```json\n{\n  \"task_id\": \"4.7\",\n  \"status\": \"failed\",\n  \"message\": \"What went wrong and why\",\n  \"timestamp\": \"2026-01-19T12:00:00Z\",\n  \"plan_modified\": false\n}\n```\n\n### Step 7: Commit Changes\n\n```bash\ngit add -A\ngit commit -m \"feat: Task description\n\n- What changed\n- Why it changed\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\"\n```\n\n### Step 8: Update Plan (if not using orchestrator)\n\nIf running manually (not via orchestrator), update the task status in the YAML:\n```yaml\n- id: '4.7'\n  status: completed\n  completed_at: '2026-01-19T12:00:00'\n  result_message: Brief description\n```\n\n## Plan Modification\n\nYou MAY modify the YAML plan if needed:\n- **Split a task** that's too large (e.g., 5.2 -> 5.2a, 5.2b)\n- **Add a task** if something is missing\n- **Skip a task** by setting `status: skipped` with a reason\n- **Add notes** with important context\n\nIf you modify the plan, set `plan_modified: true` in the status file.\n\n## Important Rules\n\n1. ALWAYS read `CODING-RULES.md` before generating code\n2. Fix ALL test failures before marking complete\n3. If build fails, fix the errors before proceeding\n4. Keep changes minimal and focused on the task\n5. ALWAYS write the status file when done\n6. COMMIT after completing each task\n\n## Error Handling\n\nIf the task fails:\n1. Write status file with `status: failed` and clear message\n2. Document what went wrong\n3. The orchestrator will retry (up to max_attempts)\n4. After max attempts, the circuit breaker will trip and the human can investigate\n\n## Creating New YAML Plans\n\nTo create a new plan:\n1. Write detailed design to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-feature-design.md`\n2. Create YAML plan in `.claude/plans/<feature>.yaml`\n3. Reference the design doc in `meta.plan_doc`\n4. Break work into sections and tasks\n5. For UI features or other complex architecture questions where multiple valid approaches\n   exist, consider using the Phase 0 design competition pattern. This is especially valuable\n   when the team needs to explore different UX layouts, API designs, data model strategies,\n   or component architectures before committing to an implementation. Five parallel agents\n   each develop a distinct approach, then an AI judge scores them on predefined criteria\n   and selects the winner --- removing the bottleneck of human design review while still\n   ensuring quality through structured evaluation. The winning design feeds directly into\n   the implementation phases via the self-extending plan pattern.\n6. Run orchestrator to execute\n\nExample command to start:\n```bash\npython scripts/plan-orchestrator.py --plan .claude/plans/my-feature.yaml --dry-run\n```\n"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"837e5117-4561-400c-a166-6377275c7247","uuid":"97aa561b-0b16-49eb-bdce-d51ffe79c109","isSynthetic":true}

Both scripts already call load_orchestrator_config() at module level, so the new keys are read the same way. Template strings use Python .format() interpolation with the new values.\n\n**Affected Files:**\n- scripts/auto-pipeline.py - VERIFICATION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE and verify_item()\n- scripts/plan-orchestrator.py - task prompt and smoke test messages\n- .claude/orchestrator-config.yaml - new documented fields\n\n---\n\n## Phase 1: Configuration Extension\n\n### Task 1.1: Add command config keys to auto-pipeline.py\n\n**Files:**\n- Modify: scripts/auto-pipeline.py (lines ~43, ~72)\n\n**Design:**\n\nAdd three default constants alongside DEFAULT_DEV_SERVER_PORT:\n\n    DEFAULT_BUILD_COMMAND = \"pnpm run build\"\n    DEFAULT_TEST_COMMAND = \"pnpm test\"\n    DEFAULT_DEV_SERVER_COMMAND = \"pnpm dev\"\n\nRead them from _config the same way DEV_SERVER_PORT is read:\n\n    BUILD_COMMAND = _config.get(\"build_command\", DEFAULT_BUILD_COMMAND)\n    TEST_COMMAND = _config.get(\"test_command\", DEFAULT_TEST_COMMAND)\n    DEV_SERVER_COMMAND = _config.get(\"dev_server_command\", DEFAULT_DEV_SERVER_COMMAND)\n\n### Task 1.2: Update VERIFICATION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE in auto-pipeline.py\n\n**Files:**\n- Modify: scripts/auto-pipeline.py (lines ~1057-1109)\n\n**Design:**\n\nReplace the three hardcoded pnpm references with format placeholders:\n\n- Line ~1075: \"Does pnpm run build pass?\" -> \"Does {build_command} pass?\"\n- Line ~1076: \"Do unit tests pass? (pnpm test)\" -> \"Do unit tests pass? ({test_command})\"\n- Line ~1107: \"start it with pnpm dev\" -> \"start it with {dev_server_command}\"\n\n### Task 1.3: Update verify_item() to pass new format values\n\n**Files:**\n- Modify: scripts/auto-pipeline.py (line ~1159)\n\n**Design:**\n\nThe VERIFICATION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE.format() call currently passes item_path, slug, and count.

Read the backlog item file: {item_path}\n2. Read procedure-coding-rules.md for coding standards\n3. Read an existing YAML plan for format reference: look at .claude/plans/*.yaml files\n4. Read the CLAUDE.md file for project conventions\n5. If the backlog item has a ## Verification Log section, READ IT CAREFULLY.\n   Previous fix attempts and their verification results are recorded there.\n   Your plan MUST address any unresolved findings from prior verifications.\n\n## What to produce\n\n1. Create a design document at: docs/plans/{date}-{slug}-design.md\n   - Brief architecture overview\n   - Key files to create/modify\n   - Design decisions\n\n2. Create a YAML plan at: .claude/plans/{slug}.yaml\n   - Use the exact format: meta + sections with nested tasks\n   - Each section has: id, name, status: pending, tasks: [...]\n   - Each task has: id, name, description, status: pending\n   - Task descriptions should be detailed enough for a fresh Claude session to execute\n   - Include: documentation tasks, implementation tasks, unit tests, verification\n   - The verification task should run pnpm run build and pnpm test\n\n3. Validate the plan: python scripts/plan-orchestrator.py --plan .claude/plans/{slug}.yaml --dry-run\n   - If validation fails, fix the YAML format and retry\n\n4. Git commit both files with message: \"plan: add {slug} design and YAML plan\"\n\n## Backlog item type: {item_type}\n\n## Important\n- Follow the CLAUDE.md change workflow order: docs -> code -> tests -> verification\n- For defects: include a task to verify the fix with a regression test\n- For features: include documentation, implementation, unit tests, and E2E tests as appropriate\n- Keep tasks focused - each task should be completable in one Claude session (under 10 minutes)\n- If the backlog item has a ## Verification Log with unresolved findings, your plan\n  must specifically address those findings.

Your job is to check whether a defect's\nreported symptoms have been fully resolved. You must NOT fix anything. You only observe and report.\n\n## Instructions\n\n1. Read the defect file: {item_path}\n2. Read the \"Expected Behavior\" and \"Actual Behavior\" sections carefully\n3. Read the \"Fix Required\" section for any commands or checks that should be performed\n4. If there is a \"## Verification Log\" section, read previous verification attempts\n\n## What to check\n\nFor each item in \"Fix Required\" or \"Verification\" that describes a testable condition:\n- Run the command or check the condition\n- Record whether it passed or failed\n- Record the actual output or observation\n\nAlso check:\n- Does `pnpm run build` pass? (code correctness)\n- Do unit tests pass? (`pnpm test`)\n- Is the reported symptom actually gone?

Read the backlog item file: {item_path}\n2. Read procedure-coding-rules.md for coding standards\n3. Read an existing YAML plan for format reference: look at .claude/plans/*.yaml files\n4. Read the CLAUDE.md file for project conventions\n5. If the backlog item has a ## Verification Log section, READ IT CAREFULLY.\n   Previous fix attempts and their verification results are recorded there.\n   Your plan MUST address any unresolved findings from prior verifications.\n\n## What to produce\n\n1. Create a design document at: docs/plans/{date}-{slug}-design.md\n   - Brief architecture overview\n   - Key files to create/modify\n   - Design decisions\n\n2. Create a YAML plan at: .claude/plans/{slug}.yaml\n   - Use the exact format: meta + sections with nested tasks\n   - Each section has: id, name, status: pending, tasks: [...]\n   - Each task has: id, name, description, status: pending\n   - Task descriptions should be detailed enough for a fresh Claude session to execute\n   - Include: documentation tasks, implementation tasks, unit tests, verification\n   - The verification task should run pnpm run build and pnpm test\n\n3. Validate the plan: python scripts/plan-orchestrator.py --plan .claude/plans/{slug}.yaml --dry-run\n   - If validation fails, fix the YAML format and retry\n\n4. Git commit both files with message: \"plan: add {slug} design and YAML plan\"\n\n## Backlog item type: {item_type}\n\n## Important\n- Follow the CLAUDE.md change workflow order: docs -> code -> tests -> verification\n- For defects: include a task to verify the fix with a regression test\n- For features: include documentation, implementation, unit tests, and E2E tests as appropriate\n- Keep tasks focused - each task should be completable in one Claude session (under 10 minutes)\n- If the backlog item has a ## Verification Log with unresolved findings, your plan\n  must specifically address those findings.

Your job is to check whether a defect's\nreported symptoms have been fully resolved. You must NOT fix anything. You only observe and report.\n\n## Instructions\n\n1. Read the defect file: {item_path}\n2. Read the \"Expected Behavior\" and \"Actual Behavior\" sections carefully\n3. Read the \"Fix Required\" section for any commands or checks that should be performed\n4. If there is a \"## Verification Log\" section, read previous verification attempts\n\n## What to check\n\nFor each item in \"Fix Required\" or \"Verification\" that describes a testable condition:\n- Run the command or check the condition\n- Record whether it passed or failed\n- Record the actual output or observation\n\nAlso check:\n- Does `{build_command}` pass?
