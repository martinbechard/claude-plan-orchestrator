This validator reads the original defect file and checks whether reported symptoms are resolved.\n   831→\n   832→## Important\n   833→- Follow the CLAUDE.md change workflow order: docs -> code -> tests -> verification\n   834→- For defects: include a task to verify the fix with a regression test\n   835→- For features: include documentation, implementation, unit tests, and E2E tests as appropriate\n   836→- Keep tasks focused - each task should be completable in one Claude session (under 10 minutes)\n   837→- If the backlog item has a ## Verification Log with unresolved findings, your plan\n   838→  must specifically address those findings.

Read the backlog item file: {item_path}\n2. Read procedure-coding-rules.md for coding standards\n3. Read an existing YAML plan for format reference: look at .claude/plans/*.yaml files\n4. Read the CLAUDE.md file for project conventions\n5. If the backlog item has a ## Verification Log section, READ IT CAREFULLY.\n   Previous fix attempts and their verification results are recorded there.\n   Your plan MUST address any unresolved findings from prior verifications.\n\n## What to produce\n\n1. Create a design document at: docs/plans/{date}-{slug}-design.md\n   - Brief architecture overview\n   - Key files to create/modify\n   - Design decisions\n\n2. Create a YAML plan at: .claude/plans/{slug}.yaml\n   - Use the exact format: meta + sections with nested tasks\n   - Each section has: id, name, status: pending, tasks: [...]\n   - Each task has: id, name, description, status: pending\n   - Task descriptions should be detailed enough for a fresh Claude session to execute\n   - Include: documentation tasks, implementation tasks, unit tests, verification\n   - The verification task should run {build_command} and {test_command}\n\n3. Validate the plan: python scripts/plan-orchestrator.py --plan .claude/plans/{slug}.yaml --dry-run\n   - If validation fails, fix the YAML format and retry\n\n4. Git commit both files with message: \"plan: add {slug} design and YAML plan\"\n\n## Backlog item type: {item_type}\n\n## Agent Selection\n\nTasks can specify which agent should execute them via the optional \"agent\" field.\nAvailable agents are in {agents_dir}:\n\n- **coder**: Implementation specialist. Use for coding, implementation, and\n  modification tasks. This is the default if no agent is specified.\n- **code-reviewer**: Read-only reviewer. Use for verification, review, and\n  compliance-checking tasks.\n\nExample:\n  - id: '2.1'\n    name: Implement the feature\n    agent: coder\n    status: pending\n    description: ...\n\n  - id: '3.1'\n    name: Review code quality\n    agent: code-reviewer\n    status: pending\n    description: ...\n\nIf you do not set the agent field, the orchestrator will infer it from the\ntask description (verification tasks get code-reviewer, everything else gets coder).\n\n## Validation (Optional)\n\nPlans can enable per-task validation by adding a validation block to the meta section. When enabled, a validator agent runs after each coder task to independently verify the result.\n\nExample meta configuration:\n\n  meta:\n    validation:\n      enabled: true\n      run_after:\n        - coder\n      validators:\n        - validator\n      max_validation_attempts: 1\n\nThe validator produces PASS/WARN/FAIL verdicts:\n- PASS: task proceeds normally\n- WARN: task completes but warnings are logged\n- FAIL: task is retried with validation findings prepended to the prompt\n\nFor defect fixes, use the issue-verifier validator instead of or in addition to the default validator. This validator reads the original defect file and checks whether reported symptoms are resolved.\n\n## Important\n- Follow the CLAUDE.md change workflow order: docs -> code -> tests -> verification\n- For defects: include a task to verify the fix with a regression test\n- For features: include documentation, implementation, unit tests, and E2E tests as appropriate\n- Keep tasks focused - each task should be completable in one Claude session (under 10 minutes)\n- If the backlog item has a ## Verification Log with unresolved findings, your plan\n  must specifically address those findings. The previous code fix may be correct but\n  incomplete (e.g., operational steps not executed, data not deployed).\n\"\"\"\n\n\ndef reset_interrupted_tasks(plan_path: str) -> int:\n    \"\"\"Reset in_progress tasks back to pending and clear their attempt counters.\n\n    When the pipeline is killed mid-task, the orchestrator leaves tasks as\n    'in_progress'.

Your job is to check whether a defect's\nreported symptoms have been fully resolved. You must NOT fix anything. You only observe and report.\n\n## Instructions\n\n1. Read the defect file: {item_path}\n2. Read the \"Expected Behavior\" and \"Actual Behavior\" sections carefully\n3. Read the \"Fix Required\" section for any commands or checks that should be performed\n4. If there is a \"## Verification Log\" section, read previous verification attempts\n\n## What to check\n\nFor each item in \"Fix Required\" or \"Verification\" that describes a testable condition:\n- Run the command or check the condition\n- Record whether it passed or failed\n- Record the actual output or observation\n\nAlso check:\n- Does `{build_command}` pass? (code correctness)\n- Do unit tests pass? (`{test_command}`)\n- Is the reported symptom actually gone? (the MOST IMPORTANT check)\n\n## What to produce\n\nAppend your findings to the defect file at {item_path}.\nIf no \"## Verification Log\" section exists, create one at the end of the file.\n\nUse this exact format (the count MUST increment from the last entry, or start at 1):\n\n```\n### Verification #{count} -

be specific about command outputs)\n```\n\n## CRITICAL RULES\n\n- Do NOT modify any code files\n- Do NOT fix anything\n- Do NOT change the defect's ## Status line\n- ONLY read, run verification commands, and append findings to the defect file\n- If you need the dev server running for a check, start it with `{dev_server_command}`, wait for it,\n  run your check, then stop it\n- Git commit the updated defect file with message: \"verify: {slug} verification #{count}\"\n\"\"\"\n\n# Maximum number of verify-then-fix cycles before giving up\nMAX_VERIFICATION_CYCLES = 3\n\n\ndef count_verification_attempts(item_path: str) -> int:\n    \"\"\"Count how many verification entries exist in the defect file.\"\"\"\n    try:\n        with open(item_path, \"r\") as f:\n            content = f.read()\n    except IOError:\n        return 0\n\n    return len(re.findall(r\"### Verification #\\d+\", content))\n\n\ndef last_verification_passed(item_path: str) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"Check if the most recent verification entry has Verdict: PASS.\"\"\"\n    try:\n        with open(item_path, \"r\") as f:\n            content = f.read()\n    except IOError:\n        return False\n\n    # Find all verdict lines and check the last one\n    verdicts = re.findall(r\"\\*\\*Verdict:\\s*(PASS|FAIL)\\*\\*\", content, re.IGNORECASE)\n    if not verdicts:\n        return False\n    return verdicts[-1].upper() == \"PASS\"\n\n\ndef verify_item(item: BacklogItem, dry_run: bool = False) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"Run symptom verification on a completed defect fix.\n\n    Returns True if verification passed, False if it failed.\n    The verifier appends findings to the defect file regardless of outcome.\n    \"\"\"\n    if item.item_type != \"defect\":\n        # Features don't have symptom verification (yet)\n        return True\n\n    attempt_count = count_verification_attempts(item.path) + 1\n\n    if dry_run:\n        log(f\"[DRY RUN] Would verify symptoms for: {item.display_name} (attempt #{attempt_count})\")\n        return True\n\n    log(f\"Running symptom verification #{attempt_count}...\")\n\n    prompt = VERIFICATION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE.format(\n        item_path=item.path,\n        slug=item.slug,\n        count=attempt_count,\n        build_command=BUILD_COMMAND,\n        test_command=TEST_COMMAND,\n        dev_server_command=DEV_SERVER_COMMAND,\n    )\n\n    cmd = [*CLAUDE_CMD, \"--dangerously-skip-permissions\", \"--print\", prompt]\n\n    result = run_child_process(\n        cmd,\n        description=f\"Verify {item.slug} #{attempt_count}\",\n        timeout=PLAN_CREATION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS,\n        show_output=VERBOSE,\n    )\n\n    if result.rate_limited:\n        log(\"Rate limited during verification\")\n        return False\n\n    if not result.success:\n        log(f\"Verification process failed (exit {result.exit_code})\")\n        return False\n\n    # Check if the verifier recorded a PASS\n    passed = last_verification_passed(item.path)\n    if passed:\n        log(f\"Verification #{attempt_count}: PASSED\")\n    else:\n        log(f\"Verification #{attempt_count}: FAILED -

The pragmatic approach is a user-configured ceiling combined with locally-tracked cost. This is simple, requires no API access, and works across all plan types.\n   211→\n   212→2. **BudgetGuard wraps PlanUsageTracker, not a separate cost counter.** Instead of maintaining its own running cost total, BudgetGuard queries PlanUsageTracker.get_total_usage().total_cost_usd directly. This avoids duplicate state and keeps cost data in one authoritative place.\n   213→\n   214→3. **BudgetGuard is separate from CircuitBreaker.** The circuit breaker handles task failures and rate limits. The budget guard handles cost thresholds. These are orthogonal concerns and should not be merged.\n   215→\n   216→4. **CLI flags override plan YAML.** This lets users run the same plan with different budgets (e.g., more conservative overnight).

Add a BudgetGuard class that checks cumulative cost (from PlanUsageTracker, Feature 06) against the configured ceiling before each task. When spending exceeds the threshold, the orchestrator pauses the plan with a \"paused_quota\" status. The auto-pipeline performs a per-work-item budget check and stops processing new items when the budget is exhausted. No external quota API is required; the system uses locally-tracked cost data combined with a user-configured ceiling.\n\n**Tech Stack:** Python 3 (plan-orchestrator.py, auto-pipeline.py), YAML (plan meta.budget configuration)\n\n---\n\n## Architecture Overview\n\n### Dependency: Feature 06 (Token Usage Tracking)\n\nThis feature builds directly on the TaskUsage dataclass, PlanUsageTracker, and per-task cost data introduced by Feature 06. Specifically:\n\n- TaskResult.usage provides per-task cost via total_cost_usd\n- PlanUsageTracker.get_total_usage() provides cumulative plan cost\n- Usage report JSON files provide cross-plan session cost data\n\nFeature 06 is already implemented.\n\n### BudgetConfig Dataclass\n\nNew dataclass to hold budget configuration, placed after PlanUsageTracker in plan-orchestrator.py:\n\n    @dataclass\n    class BudgetConfig:\n        \"\"\"Budget limits for plan execution.\"\"\"\n        max_quota_percent: float = DEFAULT_MAX_QUOTA_PERCENT   # 100.0\n        quota_ceiling_usd: float = DEFAULT_QUOTA_CEILING_USD   # 0.0 = unlimited\n        reserved_budget_usd: float = DEFAULT_RESERVED_BUDGET_USD  # 0.0\n\n        @property\n        def effective_limit_usd(self) -> float:\n            \"\"\"Calculate effective spending limit in USD.\"\"\"\n            if self.quota_ceiling_usd <= 0:\n                return float('inf')\n            percent_limit = self.quota_ceiling_usd * (self.max_quota_percent / 100.0)\n            if self.reserved_budget_usd > 0:\n                reserve_limit = self.quota_ceiling_usd - self.reserved_budget_usd\n                return min(percent_limit, reserve_limit)\n            return percent_limit\n\n        @property\n        def is_enabled(self) -> bool:\n            \"\"\"Whether budget enforcement is active.\"\"\"\n            return self.quota_ceiling_usd > 0\n\nConfiguration sources (in priority order):\n1. CLI flags: --max-budget-pct, --quota-ceiling, --reserved-budget\n2. Plan YAML meta.budget block\n3. Defaults (100% / unlimited = no budget enforcement)\n\n### BudgetGuard Class\n\nStateful guard that wraps PlanUsageTracker and enforces limits. It does not maintain its own cost counter; it queries the tracker directly.\n\n    class BudgetGuard:\n        \"\"\"Checks cumulative cost against budget limits before each task.\"\"\"\n\n        def __init__(self, config: BudgetConfig, usage_tracker: PlanUsageTracker):\n            self.config = config\n            self.usage_tracker = usage_tracker\n\n        def can_proceed(self) -> tuple[bool, str]:\n            \"\"\"Check if budget allows another task.\n            Returns (can_proceed, reason_if_not).\n            \"\"\"\n            if not self.config.is_enabled:\n                return (True, \"\")\n            total = self.usage_tracker.get_total_usage()\n            spent = total.total_cost_usd\n            limit = self.config.effective_limit_usd\n            if spent >= limit:\n                pct = (spent / self.config.quota_ceiling_usd * 100) if self.config.quota_ceiling_usd > 0 else 0\n                reason = (\n                    f\"Budget limit reached: ${spent:.4f} / ${limit:.4f} \"\n                    f\"({pct:.1f}% of ${self.config.quota_ceiling_usd:.2f} ceiling)\"\n                )\n                return (False, reason)\n            return (True, \"\")\n\n        def get_usage_percent(self) -> float:\n            \"\"\"Current spending as percentage of ceiling.\"\"\"\n            if not self.config.is_enabled:\n                return 0.0\n            total = self.usage_tracker.get_total_usage()\n            return (total.total_cost_usd / self.config.quota_ceiling_usd * 100)\n\n        def format_status(self) -> str:\n            \"\"\"Format current budget status for display.\"\"\"\n            if not self.config.is_enabled:\n                return \"[Budget: unlimited]\"\n            total = self.usage_tracker.get_total_usage()\n            spent = total.total_cost_usd\n            limit = self.config.effective_limit_usd\n            pct = self.get_usage_percent()\n            return f\"[Budget: ${spent:.4f} / ${limit:.4f} ({pct:.1f}% of ceiling)]\"\n\nThe guard returns a tuple so the caller gets both the decision and a human-readable explanation.\n\n### Plan YAML Configuration\n\nBudget settings in the plan meta block:\n\n    meta:\n      name: My Feature\n      budget:\n        max_quota_percent: 90\n        quota_ceiling_usd: 100.00\n\nWhen no budget block is present, no budget enforcement occurs (backwards compatible).\n\n### CLI Flags\n\nNew orchestrator flags:\n\n    --max-budget-pct N       Maximum % of quota ceiling to use (default: 100)\n    --quota-ceiling N.NN     Weekly quota ceiling in USD (default: 0 = unlimited)\n    --reserved-budget N.NN   USD amount to reserve for interactive use (default: 0)\n\nCLI flags override plan YAML values when both are specified.\n\n### parse_budget_config Helper\n\nA helper function parses BudgetConfig from both the plan meta and CLI args:\n\n    def parse_budget_config(plan: dict, args: argparse.Namespace) -> BudgetConfig:\n        \"\"\"Parse budget configuration from plan YAML and CLI overrides.\"\"\"\n        budget_meta = plan.get(\"meta\", {}).get(\"budget\", {})\n        config = BudgetConfig(\n            max_quota_percent=budget_meta.get(\"max_quota_percent\", DEFAULT_MAX_QUOTA_PERCENT),\n            quota_ceiling_usd=budget_meta.get(\"quota_ceiling_usd\", DEFAULT_QUOTA_CEILING_USD),\n            reserved_budget_usd=budget_meta.get(\"reserved_budget_usd\", DEFAULT_RESERVED_BUDGET_USD),\n        )\n        # CLI overrides\n        if hasattr(args, 'max_budget_pct') and args.max_budget_pct is not None:\n            config.max_quota_percent = args.max_budget_pct\n        if hasattr(args, 'quota_ceiling') and args.quota_ceiling is not None:\n            config.quota_ceiling_usd = args.quota_ceiling\n        if hasattr(args, 'reserved_budget') and args.reserved_budget is not None:\n            config.reserved_budget_usd = args.reserved_budget\n        return config\n\n### Pre-Task Check in Orchestrator\n\nIn run_orchestrator(), after the existing circuit breaker check and before task execution:\n\n1. Call budget_guard.can_proceed()\n2. If False, print the reason, set meta.status to \"paused_quota\", save the plan, and break\n3. After each task completes, the usage is already recorded in usage_tracker (no extra step needed since BudgetGuard reads from it)\n\nThe check happens in the main task loop:\n- Sequential path (around line 2374, after circuit breaker check)\n- Parallel path (around line 2396, before parallel group execution)\n\n### Plan Pause Behavior\n\nWhen budget is exhausted:\n\n1. The current task completes (no mid-task interruption)\n2. Plan YAML is updated: meta.status becomes \"paused_quota\"\n3. A meta.pause_reason is written with the budget explanation\n4. The usage report is generated (from PlanUsageTracker)\n5. run_orchestrator() exits with code 0 (not a failure)\n\nA paused plan can be resumed later with --resume-from, and the budget guard re-evaluates from current spending.\n\n### Auto-Pipeline Integration\n\nThe auto-pipeline checks session-level spending across work items using SessionUsageTracker.total_cost_usd:\n\n1. Parse budget config from CLI flags (--max-budget-pct, --quota-ceiling)\n2. Create a PipelineBudgetGuard that checks SessionUsageTracker.total_cost_usd against the ceiling\n3. Before starting each new work item, check can_proceed()\n4. If budget exhausted, log the reason and break the main loop\n\nThe auto-pipeline budget check is per-work-item (coarser granularity than per-task).\n\n### Exit Codes\n\nThe orchestrator uses specific exit behavior for budget pauses:\n\n- Exit code 0: Plan paused due to budget (not a failure)\n- The auto-pipeline detects \"paused_quota\" in the plan YAML after execution\n- This is distinct from exit code 1 (real failure) and rate-limit retries\n\n---\n\n## Key Files\n\n### Modified Files\n\n| File | Change |\n|------|--------|\n| scripts/plan-orchestrator.py | BudgetConfig, BudgetGuard, parse_budget_config, pre-task check, CLI flags, plan pause logic |\n| scripts/auto-pipeline.py | PipelineBudgetGuard, per-work-item check, CLI flags |\n\n### New Files\n\n| File | Purpose |\n|------|---------|\n| tests/test_budget_guard.py | Unit tests for BudgetConfig, BudgetGuard, parse_budget_config |\n\n---\n\n## Design Decisions\n\n1. **User-configured ceiling, not API-queried quota.** There is no known programmatic API to query remaining Claude weekly quota. The pragmatic approach is a user-configured ceiling combined with locally-tracked cost. This is simple, requires no API access, and works across all plan types.\n\n2. **BudgetGuard wraps PlanUsageTracker, not a separate cost counter.** Instead of maintaining its own running cost total, BudgetGuard queries PlanUsageTracker.get_total_usage().total_cost_usd directly. This avoids duplicate state and keeps cost data in one authoritative place.\n\n3. **BudgetGuard is separate from CircuitBreaker.** The circuit breaker handles task failures and rate limits. The budget guard handles cost thresholds. These are orthogonal concerns and should not be merged.\n\n4. **CLI flags override plan YAML.** This lets users run the same plan with different budgets (e.g., more conservative overnight). The plan YAML provides defaults, the CLI provides overrides.\n\n5. **Pause, don't fail.** Budget exhaustion is a normal operational condition, not an error. The plan is paused, not failed, and can be resumed when more budget is available. Exit code 0 signals this.\n\n6. **Session-scoped spending, not weekly aggregation.** Tracking weekly spending across sessions would require reading all historical usage reports and summing them for the current billing week. This adds complexity (billing cycle detection, timezone handling). The MVP tracks spending within a single orchestrator run or pipeline session. Users can set their ceiling to account for prior spending manually.\n\n7. **BudgetConfig and BudgetGuard live in plan-orchestrator.py.** Following the single-file convention established by TaskResult, CircuitBreaker, and PlanUsageTracker.\n\n8. **No cost estimation or prediction.** The \"nice to have\" cost estimation from the backlog item is deferred. Predicting task cost requires historical data that does not yet exist. The MVP checks \"have we spent too much?\" before each task.\n","numLines":225,"startLine":1,"totalLines":225}}}
