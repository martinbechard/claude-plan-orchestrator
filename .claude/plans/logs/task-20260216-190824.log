This is how the orchestrator knows the task result.\n\"\"\"\n\n\ndef run_smoke_tests() -> bool:\n    \"\"\"Run smoke tests to verify critical paths still work after plan completion.\n\n    Returns True if smoke tests pass, False otherwise.\n    Uses PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL to target an existing dev server (avoids starting a\n    competing QA server that would corrupt the shared .next cache).\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"\\n=== Running post-plan smoke tests ===\")\n    print(\"Verifying critical user paths...\")\n\n    # Detect which port has a running server\n    smoke_port = None\n    try:\n        check = subprocess.run(\n            [\"lsof\", \"-ti\", f\":{DEV_SERVER_PORT}\"],\n            capture_output=True, text=True, timeout=5\n        )\n        if check.stdout.strip():\n            smoke_port = DEV_SERVER_PORT\n    except Exception:\n        pass\n\n    if not smoke_port:\n        print(f\"[SMOKE] No dev server detected on port {DEV_SERVER_PORT} - skipping smoke tests\")\n        print(f\"[SMOKE] Start a server with '{DEV_SERVER_COMMAND}' before running smoke tests\")\n        return True  # Don't fail the plan if no server is running\n\n    print(f\"[SMOKE] Using existing server on port {smoke_port}\")\n\n    # Set env to target existing server and skip webServer startup\n    env = os.environ.copy()\n    env[\"PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL\"] = f\"http://localhost:{smoke_port}\"\n    env[\"SMOKE_SKIP_WEBSERVER\"] = \"true\"\n\n    try:\n        result = subprocess.run(\n            [\"npx\", \"playwright\", \"test\", \"tests/SMOKE01-critical-paths.spec.ts\",\n             \"--reporter=list\", \"--timeout=30000\",\n             \"--project=chromium\"],\n            capture_output=True,\n            text=True,\n            timeout=180,\n            cwd=os.getcwd(),\n            env=env\n        )\n\n        if result.returncode == 0:\n            print(\"[SMOKE] All smoke tests PASSED\")\n            return True\n        else:\n            print(f\"[SMOKE] Smoke tests FAILED (exit code {result.returncode})\")\n            # Show relevant output\n            for line in result.stdout.splitlines()[-20:]:\n                print(f\"  {line}\")\n            if result.stderr:\n                for line in result.stderr.splitlines()[-10:]:\n                    print(f\"  [stderr] {line}\")\n            return False\n    except subprocess.TimeoutExpired:\n        print(\"[SMOKE] Smoke tests TIMED OUT (180s)\")\n        return False\n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        print(\"[SMOKE] npx/playwright not found - skipping smoke tests\")\n        return True  # Don't fail the plan if playwright isn't installed\n\n\nclass OutputCollector:\n    \"\"\"Collects output from Claude CLI and tracks stats.\"\"\"\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.lines: list[str] = []\n        self.bytes_received = 0\n        self.line_count = 0\n\n    def add_line(self, line: str) -> None:\n        self.lines.append(line)\n        self.bytes_received += len(line.encode('utf-8'))\n        self.line_count += 1\n\n    def get_output(self) -> str:\n        return ''.join(self.lines)\n\n\ndef stream_output(pipe, prefix: str, collector: OutputCollector, show_full: bool) -> None:\n    \"\"\"Stream output from a subprocess pipe line by line.\"\"\"\n    try:\n        for line in iter(pipe.readline, ''):\n            if line:\n                collector.add_line(line)\n                if show_full:\n                    print(f\"[CLAUDE {prefix}] {line.rstrip()}\", flush=True)\n    except Exception as e:\n        if VERBOSE:\n            verbose_log(f\"Error streaming {prefix}: {e}\", \"ERROR\")\n\n\ndef stream_json_output(pipe, collector: OutputCollector, result_capture: dict) -> None:\n    \"\"\"Stream output from Claude CLI in stream-json format, showing tool use and text in real-time.\n\n    Args:\n        pipe: The stdout pipe from the Claude CLI subprocess.\n        collector: OutputCollector that accumulates raw output lines.\n        result_capture: A mutable dict that will be populated with the full result event data\n            when the 'result' event is received.

This is how the orchestrator knows the task result.\n\"\"\"\n\n\ndef run_smoke_tests() -> bool:\n    \"\"\"Run smoke tests to verify critical paths still work after plan completion.\n\n    Returns True if smoke tests pass, False otherwise.\n    Uses PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL to target an existing dev server (avoids starting a\n    competing QA server that would corrupt the shared .next cache).\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"\\n=== Running post-plan smoke tests ===\")\n    print(\"Verifying critical user paths...\")\n\n    # Detect which port has a running server\n    smoke_port = None\n    try:\n        check = subprocess.run(\n            [\"lsof\", \"-ti\", f\":{DEV_SERVER_PORT}\"],\n            capture_output=True, text=True, timeout=5\n        )\n        if check.stdout.strip():\n            smoke_port = DEV_SERVER_PORT\n    except Exception:\n        pass\n\n    if not smoke_port:\n        print(f\"[SMOKE] No dev server detected on port {DEV_SERVER_PORT} - skipping smoke tests\")\n        print(f\"[SMOKE] Start a server with '{DEV_SERVER_COMMAND}' before running smoke tests\")\n        return True  # Don't fail the plan if no server is running\n\n    print(f\"[SMOKE] Using existing server on port {smoke_port}\")\n\n    # Set env to target existing server and skip webServer startup\n    env = os.environ.copy()\n    env[\"PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL\"] = f\"http://localhost:{smoke_port}\"\n    env[\"SMOKE_SKIP_WEBSERVER\"] = \"true\"\n\n    try:\n        result = subprocess.run(\n            [\"npx\", \"playwright\", \"test\", \"tests/SMOKE01-critical-paths.spec.ts\",\n             \"--reporter=list\", \"--timeout=30000\",\n             \"--project=chromium\"],\n            capture_output=True,\n            text=True,\n            timeout=180,\n            cwd=os.getcwd(),\n            env=env\n        )\n\n        if result.returncode == 0:\n            print(\"[SMOKE] All smoke tests PASSED\")\n            return True\n        else:\n            print(f\"[SMOKE] Smoke tests FAILED (exit code {result.returncode})\")\n            # Show relevant output\n            for line in result.stdout.splitlines()[-20:]:\n                print(f\"  {line}\")\n            if result.stderr:\n                for line in result.stderr.splitlines()[-10:]:\n                    print(f\"  [stderr] {line}\")\n            return False\n    except subprocess.TimeoutExpired:\n        print(\"[SMOKE] Smoke tests TIMED OUT (180s)\")\n        return False\n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        print(\"[SMOKE] npx/playwright not found - skipping smoke tests\")\n        return True  # Don't fail the plan if playwright isn't installed\n\n\nclass OutputCollector:\n    \"\"\"Collects output from Claude CLI and tracks stats.\"\"\"\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.lines: list[str] = []\n        self.bytes_received = 0\n        self.line_count = 0\n\n    def add_line(self, line: str) -> None:\n        self.lines.append(line)\n        self.bytes_received += len(line.encode('utf-8'))\n        self.line_count += 1\n\n    def get_output(self) -> str:\n        return ''.join(self.lines)\n\n\ndef stream_output(pipe, prefix: str, collector: OutputCollector, show_full: bool) -> None:\n    \"\"\"Stream output from a subprocess pipe line by line.\"\"\"\n    try:\n        for line in iter(pipe.readline, ''):\n            if line:\n                collector.add_line(line)\n                if show_full:\n                    print(f\"[CLAUDE {prefix}] {line.rstrip()}\", flush=True)\n    except Exception as e:\n        if VERBOSE:\n            verbose_log(f\"Error streaming {prefix}: {e}\", \"ERROR\")\n\n\ndef stream_json_output(pipe, collector: OutputCollector, result_capture: dict) -> None:\n    \"\"\"Stream output from Claude CLI in stream-json format, showing tool use and text in real-time.\n\n    Args:\n        pipe: The stdout pipe from the Claude CLI subprocess.\n        collector: OutputCollector that accumulates raw output lines.\n        result_capture: A mutable dict that will be populated with the full result event data\n            when the 'result' event is received.
