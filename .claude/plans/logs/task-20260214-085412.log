Read the winning design document thoroughly\n    29→2. Read the judge's feedback and scoring (if available)\n    30→3. Read the existing YAML plan to understand current structure\n    31→4. Read the project's coding rules (CODING-RULES.md or equivalent)\n    32→5.

If the last section\n    39→  is \"phase-2\", your first new section is \"phase-3\".\n    40→- **Task IDs:** Continue from the last existing task ID. If the last task is \"2.4\",\n    41→  your first new task is \"3.1\" (first task in the new section).\n    42→- **Task Descriptions:** Detailed enough for a fresh Claude session to execute\n    43→  without additional context. Include specific file paths, what to change, and\n    44→  expected outcomes.\n    45→- **Agent Assignments:** Use \"coder\" for implementation tasks, \"code-reviewer\" for\n    46→  verification tasks. Assign other agents only when the task specifically requires\n    47→  their capabilities.\n    48→- **Dependencies:** Use depends_on to express build order between tasks. Earlier\n    49→  tasks that produce files needed by later tasks must be listed as dependencies.\n    50→- **Parallel Groups:** Assign parallel_group to independent tasks that can run\n    51→  concurrently. Tasks in the same parallel group execute simultaneously.\n    52→- **Verification Task:** Every section should end with a verification task that\n    53→  checks both build success and test results.\n    54→\n    55→## Plan Quality Criteria\n    56→\n    57→- **Session-Sized Tasks:** Each task must be completable in one Claude session\n    58→  (under 10 minutes). If a task seems too large, split it into subtasks.\n    59→- **Specific File Paths:** Task descriptions must include the exact file paths to\n    60→  create or modify. Never leave the implementer guessing which files to touch.\n    61→- **Valid DAG:** Dependencies must form a directed acyclic graph. No circular\n    62→  dependencies allowed.\n    63→- **Build Order:** Follow the docs -> code -> tests -> verification order within\n    64→  each section. Create interfaces before implementations, implementations before\n    65→  tests.\n    66→- **Reference Lines:** When modifying existing files, reference approximate line\n    67→  numbers or surrounding code landmarks to help the implementer locate the right\n    68→  section.\n    69→\n    70→## Constraints\n    71→\n    72→- Use the Write tool to modify the YAML plan file.

Your job is to read a winning design from a\nPhase 0 competition and translate it into concrete YAML implementation phases\nthat the orchestrator can execute. You bridge the gap between design and\nimplementation.\n\n## Before Planning\n\nComplete this checklist before creating the plan:\n\n1. Read the winning design document thoroughly\n2. Read the judge's feedback and scoring (if available)\n3. Read the existing YAML plan to understand current structure\n4. Read the project's coding rules (CODING-RULES.md or equivalent)\n5. Identify which files need to be created vs. modified\n\n## Plan Output Structure\n\nAppend new sections to the YAML plan with:\n\n- **Section IDs:** Continue from the last existing section ID. If the last section\n  is \"phase-2\", your first new section is \"phase-3\".\n- **Task IDs:** Continue from the last existing task ID. If the last task is \"2.4\",\n  your first new task is \"3.1\" (first task in the new section).\n- **Task Descriptions:** Detailed enough for a fresh Claude session to execute\n  without additional context. Include specific file paths, what to change, and\n  expected outcomes.\n- **Agent Assignments:** Use \"coder\" for implementation tasks, \"code-reviewer\" for\n  verification tasks. Assign other agents only when the task specifically requires\n  their capabilities.\n- **Dependencies:** Use depends_on to express build order between tasks. Earlier\n  tasks that produce files needed by later tasks must be listed as dependencies.\n- **Parallel Groups:** Assign parallel_group to independent tasks that can run\n  concurrently. Tasks in the same parallel group execute simultaneously.\n- **Verification Task:** Every section should end with a verification task that\n  checks both build success and test results.\n\n## Plan Quality Criteria\n\n- **Session-Sized Tasks:** Each task must be completable in one Claude session\n  (under 10 minutes). If a task seems too large, split it into subtasks.\n- **Specific File Paths:** Task descriptions must include the exact file paths to\n  create or modify. Never leave the implementer guessing which files to touch.\n- **Valid DAG:** Dependencies must form a directed acyclic graph. No circular\n  dependencies allowed.\n- **Build Order:** Follow the docs -> code -> tests -> verification order within\n  each section. Create interfaces before implementations, implementations before\n  tests.\n- **Reference Lines:** When modifying existing files, reference approximate line\n  numbers or surrounding code landmarks to help the implementer locate the right\n  section.\n\n## Constraints\n\n- Use the Write tool to modify the YAML plan file. Read the current plan first,\n  then write the updated version.\n- Set plan_modified: true in the status file so the orchestrator reloads the plan.\n- Do NOT implement any code. Your only output is the updated YAML plan.\n- Follow the exact YAML schema used by plan-orchestrator.py. Match the field names,\n  indentation, and structure of existing sections in the plan.\n\n## Output Protocol\n\nWhen your plan is complete, write a status file to .claude/plans/task-status.json:\n\n    {\n      \"task_id\": \"<the task id>\",\n      \"status\": \"completed\",\n      \"message\": \"Brief description of the plan sections added\",\n      \"timestamp\": \"<ISO 8601 timestamp>\",\n      \"plan_modified\": true\n    }\n\nThe plan_modified: true field is critical. Without it, the orchestrator will not\nreload the updated plan and your new tasks will not be executed.\n\nIf the plan cannot be created (e.g., winning design missing or unclear), set\nstatus to \"failed\" with a clear message explaining what went wrong.\n","numLines":96,"startLine":1,"totalLines":96}}}

The existing agent framework (feature 02) handles loading and prompt injection; this feature extends it with design-specific agents and inference keywords.\n\n**Tech Stack:** Python 3 (plan-orchestrator.py, auto-pipeline.py), YAML (plan schema), Markdown with YAML frontmatter (agent definitions)\n\n**Dependency:** Feature 02 (Agent Definition Framework) - completed\n\n---\n\n## Architecture Overview\n\n### New Agent Definitions\n\nThree agents join the existing coder, code-reviewer, validator, and issue-verifier:\n\n#### 1. Systems Design Agent (systems-designer.md)\n\nRole: Architecture and data model design for Phase 0 competitions.\n\n- **Focus:** TypeScript interfaces, component hierarchy, data flow diagrams, API boundaries, service architecture\n- **Evaluates:** Scalability, maintainability, integration with existing code\n- **Model:** opus (complex architectural reasoning)\n- **Tools:** Read, Grep, Glob (read-only; produces design documents, not code)\n\nOutput format: A design document with sections for architecture, data models, component hierarchy, integration points, and trade-off analysis.\n\n#### 2. UX Designer Agent (ux-designer.md)\n\nRole: Visual and interaction design for Phase 0 competitions.\n\n- **Focus:** ASCII wireframes, component specs, state diagrams, user workflows\n- **Evaluates:** Clarity, mobile UX, accessibility, consistency with existing design system\n- **Model:** opus (creative design tasks)\n- **Tools:** Read, Grep, Glob (read-only; produces design specs, not code)\n\nOutput format: A design document with ASCII wireframes for all states (normal, loading, error, empty), interaction specs, and mobile/accessibility considerations.\n\n#### 3. Planner Agent (planner.md)\n\nRole: Bridges winning designs into implementation YAML plans.\n\n- **Focus:** Reading the winning design and judge feedback, creating implementation phases with proper dependencies and agent assignments\n- **Produces:** Valid YAML task sections appended to the plan file\n- **Sets:** plan_modified: true so orchestrator reloads\n- **Model:** sonnet (structured output generation)\n- **Tools:** Read, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob (needs Write to modify the YAML plan)\n\nOutput format: YAML task sections following the project plan schema, with proper section/task IDs, dependencies, descriptions, and agent assignments.\n\n### Agent Inference Updates\n\nExpand infer_agent_for_task() in plan-orchestrator.py to recognize design-related keywords:\n\nCurrent (2 outcomes):\n- REVIEWER_KEYWORDS -> \"code-reviewer\"\n- Default -> \"coder\"\n\nAfter this feature (4 outcomes):\n- REVIEWER_KEYWORDS -> \"code-reviewer\"\n- DESIGNER_KEYWORDS (design, wireframe, layout, architecture, mockup) -> \"systems-designer\"\n- PLANNER_KEYWORDS (extend plan, create tasks, create phases, plan sections) -> \"planner\"\n- Default -> \"coder\"\n\nThe task name is also scanned (not just description) to catch short-form task names like \"Generate Design 1\".\n\nDesign decision: Single-word \"design\" maps to systems-designer by default. For UX design tasks, use the explicit agent field: agent: ux-designer. This avoids ambiguity since many architecture tasks also say \"design\" but mean systems design.\n\n### Competition Template Updates\n\nThe Phase 0 template in the implement skill (SKILL.md) and the plan creation template (PLAN_CREATION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE in auto-pipeline.py) get updated to:\n\n1. List all seven agents (coder, code-reviewer, validator, issue-verifier, systems-designer, ux-designer, planner)\n2. Show how to assign agents to Phase 0 competition tasks:\n   - Design generation tasks (0.1-0.5): agent: systems-designer or agent: ux-designer\n   - Judge task (0.6): no agent (uses default coder inference)\n   - Plan extension task (0.7): agent: planner\n3. Show agent team dispatch: when a feature needs both architecture and UX, create paired tasks (one systems-designer + one ux-designer) in the same parallel_group\n\n### Agent Team Dispatch\n\nFor features requiring both architectural and UX design, the Phase 0 template supports dispatching complementary agent pairs. This is a plan structure pattern, not orchestrator code:\n\n    - id: '0.1'\n      name: Systems Design - Approach A\n      agent: systems-designer\n      parallel_group: phase-0-designs\n      description: |\n        Create architecture design for approach A.\n        OUTPUT: Write to docs/plans/feature-design-1-systems.md\n\n    - id: '0.2'\n      name: UX Design - Approach A\n      agent: ux-designer\n      parallel_group: phase-0-designs\n      description: |\n        Create UX design complementing systems design in approach A.\n        OUTPUT: Write to docs/plans/feature-design-1-ux.md\n\nThe judge task (0.6) evaluates both the systems and UX designs as complementary pairs, scoring each pair holistically.\n\n---\n\n## Key Files\n\n### New Files\n\n| File | Purpose |\n|------|---------|\n| .claude/agents/systems-designer.md | Architecture and data model design agent |\n| .claude/agents/ux-designer.md | Visual and interaction design agent |\n| .claude/agents/planner.md | Design-to-implementation YAML plan bridge agent |\n\n### Modified Files\n\n| File | Change |\n|------|--------|\n| scripts/plan-orchestrator.py | Add DESIGNER_KEYWORDS, PLANNER_KEYWORDS; expand infer_agent_for_task() to scan name+description |\n| scripts/auto-pipeline.py | Update PLAN_CREATION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE agent list to include all 7 agents |\n| .claude/skills/implement/SKILL.md | Update Phase 0 template with agent assignments and team dispatch examples |\n\n---\n\n## Design Decisions\n\n1. **Design agents are read-only (except planner).** Systems-designer and ux-designer produce design documents, not code. They use Read/Grep/Glob only. The planner needs Write and Bash to modify the YAML plan and write status.\n\n2. **Inference defaults systems-designer for \"design\" keyword.** When a task description mentions \"design\" without specifying UX, the inference routes to systems-designer because architecture design is more common in the competition context.
