{"type":"user","message":{"role":"user","content":[{"type":"text","text":"Base directory for this skill: /Users/martinbechard/dev/claude-plan-orchestrator/.claude/skills/coding-rules\n\n# Coding Rules (Summary)\n\nThis skill provides a condensed overview of the project's coding standards. Each section\nbelow summarizes a rule category. For the full rules with rationale (the BECAUSE chains)\nand examples, read **CODING-RULES.md** at the project root.\n\n## Rule 0: File Headers and Design Traceability\n\nEvery source file must include a header comment with the file path, a one-line purpose\nsummary, and a reference to the relevant design document. Before modifying code, verify\nchanges against the design document referenced in the header. Design documents are the\nsingle source of truth for module behavior; keep them synchronized with the code.\n\n## Rule 1: Naming Conventions\n\nUse PascalCase for classes, interfaces, types, and React components. Use camelCase for\nvariables, functions, methods, and utility files. Use ALL_CAPS_SNAKE_CASE for manifest\nconstants. Use kebab-case for configuration files. File names must match their primary\nclass or component. Names must be clear, descriptive, and follow Command-Query Separation\n(nouns for queries, verbs for mutations).\n\n## Rule 2: File Organization and Imports\n\nOrganize files into standard directories (src/, scripts/, docs/, tests/). Separate shared\ncontracts (interfaces, types, constants) from implementation. Files exceeding 200 lines\nshould be refactored into a module folder with an entry point that exports only the public\nAPI. Entry points must contain only import/export statements. Organize imports as: external\nlibraries, project aliases, relative imports. Remove unused imports. Avoid circular\ndependencies.\n\n## Rule 3: Code Structure and Readability\n\nMethods should not exceed 30-40 lines; extract complex logic into helpers. Classes should\nnot exceed 300 lines. Functions with more than two parameters must use a parameter object.\nPrioritize code clarity over premature abstraction. Focus on minimal, necessary changes;\navoid over-engineering.\n\n## Rule 4: Type Safety\n\nNever use the any type; create proper typed interfaces. Use interface for contracts, type\nfor data shapes and unions, class when behavior or state is required. Avoid primitive\nobsession; use domain-specific types. Never use literal magic numbers or strings; define\nmanifest constants at the top of the file or in a constants module.\n\n## Rule 5: Coupling and Cohesion\n\nClasses must have a single responsibility (SRP). Methods must perform a single logical\noperation. Depend on interfaces rather than concrete implementations. Do not access private\nmembers of other classes. Avoid Feature Envy (move methods to where the data lives).\nUtility functions used by only one class should be private to that class.\n\n## Rule 6: Error Handling\n\nNever use empty catch blocks; always log or re-throw. Do not use exceptions for control\nflow. Provide clear error messages with context (what was attempted, which values were\ninvolved). Include variable names alongside values in log statements.\n\n## Rule 7: Comments and Documentation\n\nEvery exported symbol must have a doc comment explaining its purpose. Write comments to\nexplain why, not what. Remove commented-out code (use version control). Keep comments\naccurate and up-to-date. Avoid excessive comments; refactor for clarity instead. Remove\nTODO/FIXME comments before task completion; use the YAML plan to track remaining work.\n\n## Rule 11: Test Discipline\n\nRun related tests after any code change. Failing tests are your responsibility; fix them\nimmediately. TypeScript errors in test files count as broken tests. When splitting large\ntest suites, migrate incrementally (one group at a time, verify, continue).\n\n## Rule 12: AI-Specific Discipline\n\nNever remove existing functionality when asked to simplify. Do not add features or\nimprovements beyond what was asked. Show actual state honestly (null, empty, not configured);\nnever invent fallback data. Never defer work because a file is too large; split and\nintegrate immediately.

The validator runs the code-reviewer agent on the task's output, then aggregates findings into a PASS/WARN/FAIL verdict. On FAIL, the task is retried with findings prepended to the prompt. On WARN, the task is marked completed with warnings logged. On PASS, the task proceeds normally. Validation is opt-in via plan meta configuration.\n\n**Tech Stack:** Python 3 (plan-orchestrator.py), YAML (plan meta.validation configuration), Markdown (agent definitions in .claude/agents/)\n\n---\n\n## Architecture Overview\n\n### Dependency: Feature 02 (Agent Definition Framework)\n\nThis feature depends on the agent definition framework introduced by Feature 02. Specifically:\n- Agent markdown files in .claude/agents/ with YAML frontmatter\n- load_agent_definition() function in plan-orchestrator.py\n- build_claude_prompt() with agent content injection\n\n### Validation Flow\n\nThe validation pipeline inserts into the existing task execution flow:\n\n    1. Task executes (coder agent) -> TaskResult.success = True\n    2. Check if validation is enabled for this task type\n    3. If enabled: spawn validator agent with task context\n    4. Parse validator output for PASS/WARN/FAIL verdict\n    5. On PASS: mark task completed (normal flow)\n    6. On WARN: mark task completed, log warnings\n    7. On FAIL: mark task pending, prepend findings to next attempt\n\n### ValidationConfig Dataclass\n\nNew dataclass to hold per-plan validation settings:\n\n    @dataclass\n    class ValidationConfig:\n        \"\"\"Configuration for per-task validation.\"\"\"\n        enabled: bool = False\n        run_after: list[str]           # Agent types that trigger validation\n        validators: list[str]          # Validator agent names to run\n        max_validation_attempts: int = 1  # How many validation retries per task\n\nDefault run_after: [\"coder\"]\nDefault validators: [\"validator\"]\n\nParsed from plan meta.validation:\n\n    meta:\n      validation:\n        enabled: true\n        run_after:\n          - coder\n        validators:\n          - validator\n\n### Validation Verdict\n\n    @dataclass\n    class ValidationVerdict:\n        \"\"\"Result of a validation pass.\"\"\"\n        verdict: str     # \"PASS\", \"WARN\", or \"FAIL\"\n        findings: list[str]\n        raw_output: str\n\nThe verdict is extracted from the validator's stdout using a regex pattern matching:\n\n    **Verdict: PASS**  or  **Verdict: WARN**  or  **Verdict: FAIL**\n\n    **Findings:**\n    - [PASS|WARN|FAIL] Description with file:line references\n\n### Validator Agent Definition\n\nNew agent file: .claude/agents/validator.md\n\nThe validator agent:\n1. Receives the task description and the task result\n2. Runs build and test commands to verify the task output\n3. Checks that the task requirements from the description are met\n4. Produces a structured PASS/WARN/FAIL verdict\n\nThe validator is read-only (like code-reviewer) and uses the same output format as the VERIFICATION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE in auto-pipeline.py.\n\n### Issue Verifier Agent Definition\n\nNew agent file: .claude/agents/issue-verifier.md\n\nSpecialized for defect fix verification:\n1. Reads the original defect file\n2. Checks whether the reported symptoms are resolved\n3. Runs targeted tests mentioned in the defect file\n4. Produces a PASS/FAIL verdict with specific evidence\n\n### Validation Prompt Template\n\nThe orchestrator builds a validation prompt that includes:\n1. The validator agent content (prepended, like any agent)\n2. The original task description\n3. The task result message\n4. The files that were expected to be modified\n5. Build and test commands from orchestrator config\n\nTemplate:\n\n    You are validating the results of task {task_id}: {task_name}\n\n    ## Original Task Description\n    {task_description}\n\n    ## Task Result\n    Status: {result_status}\n    Message: {result_message}\n\n    ## Validation Checks\n    1. Run: {build_command}\n    2. Run: {test_command}\n    3. Verify the task description requirements are met\n    4. Check for regressions in related code\n\n    ## Output Format\n    Produce your verdict in this exact format:\n\n    **Verdict: PASS** or **Verdict: WARN** or **Verdict: FAIL**\n\n    **Findings:**\n    - [PASS|WARN|FAIL] Description with file:line references\n\n### Retry-with-Findings\n\nWhen a task fails validation, the orchestrator:\n1. Extracts the validation findings\n2. Prepends them to the task prompt for the next attempt\n3. The prepended block uses this format:\n\n        ## PREVIOUS VALIDATION FAILED\n\n        The previous attempt at this task was completed but failed validation.\n        You must address these findings:\n\n        {validation_findings}\n\n        ---\n\nThis is stored in a new task field: task[\"validation_findings\"] which build_claude_prompt() checks and includes if present.\n\n### Orchestrator Integration Points\n\n1. **run_orchestrator() sequential block (line ~2049):** After task_result.success is confirmed, check if validation is enabled for this task's agent type. If so, run the validation pass.\n\n2. **run_orchestrator() parallel block (line ~1830):** After parallel results are collected, validate each successful task sequentially (validators should not run in parallel to avoid conflicting state).\n\n3. **build_claude_prompt() (line ~1198):** Check for task[\"validation_findings\"] and prepend them to the prompt.\n\n---\n\n## Key Files\n\n### New Files\n\n| File | Purpose |\n|------|---------|\n| .claude/agents/validator.md | Post-task verification coordinator agent |\n| .claude/agents/issue-verifier.md | Defect fix verification specialist agent |\n\n### Modified Files\n\n| File | Change |\n|------|--------|\n| scripts/plan-orchestrator.py | Add ValidationConfig, ValidationVerdict, validation logic in task loop |\n\n---\n\n## Design Decisions\n\n1. **Validation is opt-in via plan meta.** Most plans do not need per-task validation.
