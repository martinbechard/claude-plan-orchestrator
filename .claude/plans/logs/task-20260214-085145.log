Your job is to create detailed visual and\ninteraction designs for Phase 0 design competitions. You produce design specs,\nNOT code. You analyze existing UI code to maintain consistency.\n\n## Before Designing\n\nComplete this checklist before starting your design:\n\n1. Read the competition brief / task description thoroughly\n2. Read existing UI components to understand the design system\n3. Identify layout patterns, color schemes, typography in use\n4. Read the design document referenced in the task (if any)\n\n## Design Output Structure\n\nYour design document must include these sections:\n\n- **User Flow:** Step-by-step interaction sequence. Show how the user enters the\n  feature, completes their goal, and handles errors along the way.\n- **Wireframes:** ASCII wireframes for all states (normal, loading, error, empty).\n  Show layout structure, element placement, and content hierarchy.\n- **Component Specs:** Dimensions, spacing, interactive behaviors. Define hover,\n  focus, active, and disabled states for interactive elements.\n- **State Diagrams:** Component state transitions. Show the full lifecycle of\n  stateful components including loading, success, error, and empty states.\n- **Responsive Design:** Mobile, tablet, desktop breakpoints. Show how the layout\n  adapts at each breakpoint with ASCII wireframes.\n- **Accessibility:** ARIA roles, keyboard navigation, screen reader support. Define\n  tab order, focus management, and screen reader announcements.\n- **Design System Integration:** Which existing components to reuse vs. create.\n  Reference existing patterns by file path and explain how new components fit.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nThese are the criteria the judge uses to score your design:\n\n- **Clarity (0-10):** Is the design easy to understand and implement?\n- **Mobile UX (0-10):** Works well on small screens\n- **Accessibility (0-10):** Inclusive design practices\n- **Consistency (0-10):** Matches existing design patterns\n- **Completeness (0-10):** All states and edge cases covered\n\n## Constraints\n\n- You are READ-ONLY. Never use Write, Edit, or Bash tools to modify files.\n- Only use Read, Grep, and Glob to inspect the codebase.\n- Write your design document to the OUTPUT path specified in the task description.\n- Use ASCII wireframes for all visual layouts, not images.\n- Base every design decision on evidence from the existing UI codebase.\n\n## Output Protocol\n\nWhen your design is complete, write a status file to .claude/plans/task-status.json:\n\n    {\n      \"task_id\": \"<the task id>\",\n      \"status\": \"completed\",\n      \"message\": \"Brief description of the design produced\",\n      \"timestamp\": \"<ISO 8601 timestamp>\",\n      \"plan_modified\": false\n    }\n\nIf the design cannot be completed (e.g., competition brief missing or unclear),\nset status to \"failed\" with a clear message explaining what went wrong.\n","numLines":81,"startLine":1,"totalLines":81}}}

They use Read/Grep/Glob only. The planner needs Write and Bash to modify the YAML plan and write status.\n   131→\n   132→2. **Inference defaults systems-designer for \"design\" keyword.** When a task description mentions \"design\" without specifying UX, the inference routes to systems-designer because architecture design is more common in the competition context. UX tasks should use the explicit agent: ux-designer field.\n   133→\n   134→3. **Planner uses sonnet, designers use opus.** Design generation requires creative, complex reasoning (opus).

The existing agent framework (feature 02) handles loading and prompt injection; this feature extends it with design-specific agents and inference keywords.\n\n**Tech Stack:** Python 3 (plan-orchestrator.py, auto-pipeline.py), YAML (plan schema), Markdown with YAML frontmatter (agent definitions)\n\n**Dependency:** Feature 02 (Agent Definition Framework) - completed\n\n---\n\n## Architecture Overview\n\n### New Agent Definitions\n\nThree agents join the existing coder, code-reviewer, validator, and issue-verifier:\n\n#### 1. Systems Design Agent (systems-designer.md)\n\nRole: Architecture and data model design for Phase 0 competitions.\n\n- **Focus:** TypeScript interfaces, component hierarchy, data flow diagrams, API boundaries, service architecture\n- **Evaluates:** Scalability, maintainability, integration with existing code\n- **Model:** opus (complex architectural reasoning)\n- **Tools:** Read, Grep, Glob (read-only; produces design documents, not code)\n\nOutput format: A design document with sections for architecture, data models, component hierarchy, integration points, and trade-off analysis.\n\n#### 2. UX Designer Agent (ux-designer.md)\n\nRole: Visual and interaction design for Phase 0 competitions.\n\n- **Focus:** ASCII wireframes, component specs, state diagrams, user workflows\n- **Evaluates:** Clarity, mobile UX, accessibility, consistency with existing design system\n- **Model:** opus (creative design tasks)\n- **Tools:** Read, Grep, Glob (read-only; produces design specs, not code)\n\nOutput format: A design document with ASCII wireframes for all states (normal, loading, error, empty), interaction specs, and mobile/accessibility considerations.\n\n#### 3. Planner Agent (planner.md)\n\nRole: Bridges winning designs into implementation YAML plans.\n\n- **Focus:** Reading the winning design and judge feedback, creating implementation phases with proper dependencies and agent assignments\n- **Produces:** Valid YAML task sections appended to the plan file\n- **Sets:** plan_modified: true so orchestrator reloads\n- **Model:** sonnet (structured output generation)\n- **Tools:** Read, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob (needs Write to modify the YAML plan)\n\nOutput format: YAML task sections following the project plan schema, with proper section/task IDs, dependencies, descriptions, and agent assignments.\n\n### Agent Inference Updates\n\nExpand infer_agent_for_task() in plan-orchestrator.py to recognize design-related keywords:\n\nCurrent (2 outcomes):\n- REVIEWER_KEYWORDS -> \"code-reviewer\"\n- Default -> \"coder\"\n\nAfter this feature (4 outcomes):\n- REVIEWER_KEYWORDS -> \"code-reviewer\"\n- DESIGNER_KEYWORDS (design, wireframe, layout, architecture, mockup) -> \"systems-designer\"\n- PLANNER_KEYWORDS (extend plan, create tasks, create phases, plan sections) -> \"planner\"\n- Default -> \"coder\"\n\nThe task name is also scanned (not just description) to catch short-form task names like \"Generate Design 1\".\n\nDesign decision: Single-word \"design\" maps to systems-designer by default. For UX design tasks, use the explicit agent field: agent: ux-designer. This avoids ambiguity since many architecture tasks also say \"design\" but mean systems design.\n\n### Competition Template Updates\n\nThe Phase 0 template in the implement skill (SKILL.md) and the plan creation template (PLAN_CREATION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE in auto-pipeline.py) get updated to:\n\n1. List all seven agents (coder, code-reviewer, validator, issue-verifier, systems-designer, ux-designer, planner)\n2. Show how to assign agents to Phase 0 competition tasks:\n   - Design generation tasks (0.1-0.5): agent: systems-designer or agent: ux-designer\n   - Judge task (0.6): no agent (uses default coder inference)\n   - Plan extension task (0.7): agent: planner\n3. Show agent team dispatch: when a feature needs both architecture and UX, create paired tasks (one systems-designer + one ux-designer) in the same parallel_group\n\n### Agent Team Dispatch\n\nFor features requiring both architectural and UX design, the Phase 0 template supports dispatching complementary agent pairs. This is a plan structure pattern, not orchestrator code:\n\n    - id: '0.1'\n      name: Systems Design - Approach A\n      agent: systems-designer\n      parallel_group: phase-0-designs\n      description: |\n        Create architecture design for approach A.\n        OUTPUT: Write to docs/plans/feature-design-1-systems.md\n\n    - id: '0.2'\n      name: UX Design - Approach A\n      agent: ux-designer\n      parallel_group: phase-0-designs\n      description: |\n        Create UX design complementing systems design in approach A.\n        OUTPUT: Write to docs/plans/feature-design-1-ux.md\n\nThe judge task (0.6) evaluates both the systems and UX designs as complementary pairs, scoring each pair holistically.\n\n---\n\n## Key Files\n\n### New Files\n\n| File | Purpose |\n|------|---------|\n| .claude/agents/systems-designer.md | Architecture and data model design agent |\n| .claude/agents/ux-designer.md | Visual and interaction design agent |\n| .claude/agents/planner.md | Design-to-implementation YAML plan bridge agent |\n\n### Modified Files\n\n| File | Change |\n|------|--------|\n| scripts/plan-orchestrator.py | Add DESIGNER_KEYWORDS, PLANNER_KEYWORDS; expand infer_agent_for_task() to scan name+description |\n| scripts/auto-pipeline.py | Update PLAN_CREATION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE agent list to include all 7 agents |\n| .claude/skills/implement/SKILL.md | Update Phase 0 template with agent assignments and team dispatch examples |\n\n---\n\n## Design Decisions\n\n1. **Design agents are read-only (except planner).** Systems-designer and ux-designer produce design documents, not code. They use Read/Grep/Glob only. The planner needs Write and Bash to modify the YAML plan and write status.\n\n2. **Inference defaults systems-designer for \"design\" keyword.** When a task description mentions \"design\" without specifying UX, the inference routes to systems-designer because architecture design is more common in the competition context. UX tasks should use the explicit agent: ux-designer field.\n\n3. **Planner uses sonnet, designers use opus.** Design generation requires creative, complex reasoning (opus). Plan generation is structured output that benefits from sonnet's reliability and speed.\n\n4. **Agent teams are a plan pattern, not orchestrator code.** The existing parallel_group mechanism handles agent teams naturally. No new orchestrator code is needed for team dispatch.\n\n5. **Inference checks both task name and description.** The name field is also scanned for keywords since Phase 0 tasks often have short names like \"Generate Design 1\" where the keyword appears in the name, not the description.\n\n6. **Keyword priority order.** REVIEWER_KEYWORDS are checked first (existing behavior), then DESIGNER_KEYWORDS, then PLANNER_KEYWORDS, then default \"coder\". This preserves backward compatibility.\n","numLines":141,"startLine":1,"totalLines":141}}}
