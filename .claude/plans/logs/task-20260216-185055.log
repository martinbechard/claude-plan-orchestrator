File Headers and Design Traceability\n    12→\n    13→- **RULE:** Every source file MUST include a header comment with:\n    14→  - File path (relative to project root)\n    15→  - One-line summary of the file's purpose\n    16→  - Reference to the design document that defines its behavior (if one exists)\n    17→  - **BECAUSE:** Headers create an explicit link between implementation and specification,\n    18→    preventing architectural drift.\n    19→  - **BECAUSE:** When an AI agent picks up a task in a fresh session, the header tells it\n    20→    where to find the design context without searching.\n    21→\n    22→- **RULE:** Before modifying existing code, ALWAYS verify changes against the design document\n    23→  referenced in the header. If there is a discrepancy, raise the issue rather than silently\n    24→  diverging.\n    25→  - **BECAUSE:** Ensures implementation continues to align with the agreed-upon specification.\n    26→  - **BECAUSE:** Catches unintended deviations early, before they cascade.\n    27→\n    28→- **RULE:** Major design changes or significant refactorings MUST be discussed and approved\n    29→  before implementation.\n    30→  - **BECAUSE:** Prevents costly rework if changes are later deemed undesirable.\n    31→  - **BECAUSE:** In an orchestrated plan, one agent's unauthorized design change can break\n    32→    assumptions held by subsequent tasks.\n    33→\n    34→- **RULE:** Design documents are the single source of truth for module behavior. When changing\n    35→  code, the corresponding design doc MUST be updated to reflect the changes. Conversely, when\n    36→  code seems incorrect, consult the design doc to understand the intended behavior.\n    37→  - **BECAUSE:** Synchronized design and code reduces confusion and prevents drift.\n    38→  - **BECAUSE:** Design documents provide essential context for recovering intended behavior.\n    39→\n    40→- **RULE:** After implementing changes and ensuring tests pass, ALWAYS perform a code review\n    41→  (manual or automated) against the project's standards.\n    42→  - **BECAUSE:** Code reviews catch issues that tests cannot: readability, maintainability,\n    43→    adherence to conventions, and subtle logic errors.\n    44→\n    45→## 1. Naming Conventions\n    46→\n    47→- **RULE:** Follow your language's community conventions consistently:\n    48→  - **PascalCase** for classes, interfaces, type definitions, React components\n    49→  - **camelCase** for variables, functions, methods, utility files\n    50→  - **ALL_CAPS_SNAKE_CASE** for manifest constants (values that never change at runtime)\n    51→  - **kebab-case** for configuration files and non-code assets\n    52→  - **BECAUSE:** Predictable naming reduces cognitive load. You can tell a file's purpose\n    53→    from its casing alone.\n    54→\n    55→- **RULE:** File names containing a single primary class or component MUST be named to match\n    56→  that class (e.g., `StatusManager.ts` for class `StatusManager`).\n    57→  - **BECAUSE:** Creates a predictable mapping between the artifact and the filesystem,\n    58→    reducing time spent searching for definitions.\n    59→\n    60→- **RULE:** Variable, function, and method names MUST be clear, descriptive, and reflect their\n    61→  purpose. Avoid cryptic abbreviations or overly generic names (e.g., `data`, `manager`, `temp`).\n    62→  - **BECAUSE:** The name itself should convey intent and nature, reducing the need for\n    63→    comments and preventing ambiguity.\n    64→\n    65→- **RULE:** Function/method names SHOULD indicate their purpose through word choice:\n    66→  - **Nouns/noun phrases** for functions that retrieve without side effects:\n    67→    `orderCount`, `getUserProfile`, `isActive`\n    68→  - **Verbs/verb phrases** for functions that alter state or perform actions:\n    69→    `updateStatus`, `calculateTotal`, `saveConfiguration`\n    70→  - **BECAUSE:** Signals to the reader whether calling the function might change system state.\n    71→    This is the Command-Query Separation principle.\n    72→\n    73→- **RULE:** Avoid variable names that are easily confused (e.g., `orderCount` vs `orderCounts`\n    74→  for different concepts). Be precise.\n    75→  - **BECAUSE:** Subtle naming differences for distinct concepts lead to hard-to-find bugs.\n    76→\n    77→- **RULE:** Naming conventions MUST be applied consistently across the entire codebase.\n    78→  - **BECAUSE:** A uniform style makes the codebase feel cohesive and easier to navigate.\n    79→\n    80→## 2. File Organization and Imports\n    81→\n    82→- **RULE:** Organize files into standard top-level directories based on their category:\n    83→  - `src/` - All primary source code\n    84→  - `scripts/` - Utility scripts for build, deployment, development tasks\n    85→  - `docs/` - Documentation, design documents, plans\n    86→  - `test/` or `tests/` - Test code, mocks, fixtures\n    87→  - **BECAUSE:** Establishes a conventional structure that makes it easy to locate artifacts\n    88→    and clearly separates source from supporting files.\n    89→\n    90→- **RULE:** Separate shared contracts from implementation:\n    91→  - Shared interfaces/types/constants should live in dedicated directories\n    92→    (e.g., `src/interfaces/`, `src/types/`, `src/constants/`)\n    93→  - Items used only within a single module may remain co-located in that module\n    94→  - **BECAUSE:** Centralizing shared contracts improves discoverability and prevents\n    95→    scattering definitions across modules.\n    96→  - **BECAUSE:** Clearly separates public API contracts from internal implementation details.\n    97→\n    98→- **RULE:** Any single source file exceeding 200 lines SHOULD be refactored into a module\n    99→  folder with an entry point (`index.ts`, `__init__.py`, etc.) that exports only the\n   100→  public API.\n   101→  - **BECAUSE:** Prevents excessively long files that are hard to read, understand, and maintain.\n   102→  - **BECAUSE:** Enforces a clear public API for each component.\n   103→\n   104→- **RULE:** Module entry points (e.g., `index.ts`) MUST only contain import/export statements.\n   105→  No implementation logic.\n   106→  - **BECAUSE:** The entry point defines the public contract. Mixing in logic blurs the boundary.\n   107→\n   108→- **RULE:** Each exported class SHOULD reside in its own distinct file.\n   109→  - **BECAUSE:** One file, one purpose. Makes code review and maintenance simpler.\n   110→\n   111→- **RULE:** Test files MUST mirror the source directory structure.\n   112→  - **EXAMPLE:** Tests for `src/services/workflow/Executor.ts` go in\n   113→    `test/services/workflow/Executor.test.ts`.\n   114→  - **BECAUSE:** Clear, predictable relationship between code and its tests.\n   115→\n   116→- **RULE:** Before creating a new file for a type, interface, or class, check whether a\n   117→  suitable definition already exists. If it does, import it. If it does not, create it in\n   118→  the correct location and register it in whatever central registry the project uses.\n   119→  - **BECAUSE:** Prevents duplication and ensures a single source of truth for definitions.\n   120→\n   121→- **RULE:** Organize imports logically: external libraries first, then project-level aliases,\n   122→  then relative imports. Remove all unused imports.\n   123→  - **BECAUSE:** Consistent organization improves readability and makes dependencies clearer.\n   124→  - **BECAUSE:** Unused imports clutter code and can cause confusion during refactoring.\n   125→\n   126→- **RULE:** Actively avoid and resolve circular dependencies between modules.\n   127→  - **BECAUSE:** Circular dependencies cause runtime errors, make code harder to test,\n   128→    and hinder modularity. Separating contracts into shared directories can break cycles.\n   129→\n   130→## 3. Code Structure and Readability\n   131→\n   132→- **RULE:** Methods SHOULD NOT exceed 30-40 lines. Extract complex logic into helper methods.\n   133→  - **BECAUSE:** Shorter methods are easier to understand, test, and maintain. They tend to\n   134→    have a single responsibility.\n   135→\n   136→- **RULE:** Classes SHOULD NOT exceed 300 lines. If a class grows beyond this, refactor into\n   137→  a module folder.\n   138→  - **BECAUSE:** Large classes often violate the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and\n   139→    are hard to manage.\n   140→\n   141→- **RULE:** Functions accepting more than two parameters MUST use a parameter object.\n   142→  Name the type descriptively (e.g., `CreateUserParams`, `SearchOptions`).\n   143→  - **BECAUSE:** Parameter objects improve readability and maintainability, especially when\n   144→    adding or removing parameters.\n   145→\n   146→- **RULE:** Prioritize code clarity and correctness over premature abstraction. Apply\n   147→  abstractions when patterns are clear, not speculatively.\n   148→  - **BECAUSE:** Maintainability and understandability come first. Three similar lines are\n   149→    better than a premature abstraction that nobody understands.\n   150→\n   151→- **RULE:** Focus on minimal, necessary changes to achieve the goal. Avoid over-engineering.\n   152→  - **BECAUSE:** Simpler solutions are easier to understand, test, and maintain.\n   153→  - **BECAUSE:** Minimizing scope reduces the risk of unintended side effects.\n   154→  - **BECAUSE:** In orchestrated plans, each task should do one thing well. Gold-plating\n   155→    delays the plan and introduces risk.\n   156→\n   157→## 4. Types and Type Safety\n   158→\n   159→- **RULE:** Never use `any` as a type. Always create proper types for groups of fields.\n   160→  TypeScript is all about types; using `any` defeats the purpose.\n   161→  - **BECAUSE:** `any` bypasses all type checking, hiding bugs that the compiler would\n   162→    otherwise catch.\n   163→\n   164→- **RULE:** Use the correct construct for the purpose:\n   165→  - `interface` for contracts that classes can implement or objects must adhere to\n   166→  - `type` for data shapes, function signatures, unions, intersections\n   167→  - `class` when behavior (methods), internal state, or inheritance is required\n   168→  - **BECAUSE:** Choosing the right construct signals intent and makes the code self-documenting.\n   169→\n   170→- **RULE:** Avoid \"Primitive Obsession.\" Use specific types instead of raw primitives\n   171→  (`string`, `number`, `boolean`) to represent domain concepts.\n   172→  - **EXAMPLE:** Use `type UserId = string` or `type Currency = 'USD' | 'EUR' | 'GBP'`\n   173→    instead of bare strings.\n   174→  - **BECAUSE:** Domain-specific types improve type safety, self-documentation, and\n   175→    centralize validation logic.\n   176→\n   177→- **RULE:** Groups of primitives that are always used together SHOULD be encapsulated in\n   178→  an interface or type.\n   179→  - **BECAUSE:** Improves cohesion and makes the relationship explicit.\n   180→\n   181→- **RULE:** Use type assertions (`as any`, `as unknown as Type`) sparingly, with\n   182→  justification. Fix underlying type mismatches instead.\n   183→  - **BECAUSE:** Type assertions bypass safety and can hide bugs.\n   184→\n   185→- **RULE:** Never pepper code with literal constants. Use manifest constants defined at the\n   186→  top of the file (or in a constants module) for any numeric or string value that has meaning.\n   187→  - **BECAUSE:** Magic numbers and strings are cryptic, error-prone, and hard to update.\n   188→  - **BECAUSE:** Constants with descriptive names make code self-documenting.\n   189→\n   190→## 5. Coupling and Cohesion\n   191→\n   192→- **RULE:** Classes MUST have a single, well-defined responsibility (Single Responsibility\n   193→  Principle / SRP). Each class should have one reason to change.\n   194→  - **BECAUSE:** High cohesion makes classes easier to understand, test, and maintain.\n   195→\n   196→- **RULE:** Methods MUST perform a single logical operation.\n   197→  - **BECAUSE:** Single-purpose methods are more readable and testable.\n   198→\n   199→- **RULE:** Minimize coupling between modules. Depend on interfaces rather than concrete\n   200→  implementations, especially across module boundaries.\n   201→  - **BECAUSE:** Loose coupling makes the system more flexible and resilient to change.\n   202→\n   203→- **RULE:** Do not access private members of other classes. Interact through the public API.\n   204→  - **BECAUSE:** Violating encapsulation creates tight coupling that breaks when internals change.\n   205→\n   206→- **RULE:** Avoid \"Feature Envy.\" If a method mostly operates on another class's data,\n   207→  move it to that class.\n   208→  - **BECAUSE:** Improves cohesion and reduces coupling.\n   209→\n   210→- **RULE:** Utility functions used by only one class SHOULD be private to that class or\n   211→  its module, not exported globally.\n   212→  - **BECAUSE:** Keeps related logic together and avoids polluting the module scope.\n   213→\n   214→## 6. Error Handling\n   215→\n   216→- **RULE:** Avoid empty `catch` blocks. Always log the error or re-throw appropriately.\n   217→  - **BECAUSE:** Empty catches silently swallow errors, hiding problems that compound over time.\n   218→\n   219→- **RULE:** Do not use exceptions for normal control flow. Use conditional logic instead.\n   220→  - **BECAUSE:** Misusing exceptions is inefficient and obscures the actual logic.\n   221→\n   222→- **RULE:** Provide clear, informative error messages that include context (what was being\n   223→  attempted, what values were involved).\n   224→  - **BECAUSE:** Good error messages cut debugging time from hours to minutes.\n   225→\n   226→- **RULE:** When logging, always include variable names alongside values:\n   227→  `log(\"Failed to process order: orderId=${orderId}, status=${status}\")`\n   228→  - **BECAUSE:** Knowing which variable holds which value makes trace logs dramatically\n   229→    easier to read.\n   230→\n   231→- **RULE:** When troubleshooting unexpected values, consider whether the variable name is\n   232→  misleading. Rename for clarity if so.\n   233→  - **BECAUSE:** Clear naming aids debugging by making intent explicit.\n   234→\n   235→## 7. Comments and Documentation\n   236→\n   237→- **RULE:** Every exported function, interface, type, class, and global variable MUST have\n   238→  a doc comment (JSDoc, docstring, etc.) explaining its purpose.\n   239→  - **BECAUSE:** Documentation alongside the code improves understanding and maintainability.\n   240→\n   241→- **RULE:** Write comments to explain _why_, not _what_. The code should explain the what.\n   242→  Focus on rationale, business rules, workarounds, and non-obvious decisions.\n   243→  - **BECAUSE:** The \"why\" is context that code alone cannot convey.\n   244→\n   245→- **RULE:** Remove commented-out code. That's what version control is for.\n   246→  - **BECAUSE:** Commented code is noise that becomes outdated and confusing.\n   247→\n   248→- **RULE:** Ensure comments are accurate and up-to-date. Fix or remove misleading ones.\n   249→  - **BECAUSE:** An incorrect comment is worse than no comment.\n   250→\n   251→- **RULE:** Avoid excessive comments. If you feel the need to comment heavily, refactor\n   252→  the code for clarity instead (better naming, smaller functions, clearer structure).\n   253→  - **BECAUSE:** Self-documenting code is preferred. Comments that restate the obvious add\n   254→    clutter.\n   255→\n   256→- **RULE:** Remove development-phase comments (TODO, FIXME, attribution) before task\n   257→  completion. Use task trackers and commit messages instead.\n   258→  - **BECAUSE:** Stale TODOs accumulate as noise. The orchestrator's YAML plan is the\n   259→    proper place to track remaining work.\n   260→\n   261→## 8. Conditional Logic\n   262→\n   263→- **RULE:** Avoid large `switch` statements or long `if/else if/else` chains.\n   264→  - **BECAUSE:** Hard to read, maintain, and extend. Often violates the Open-Closed Principle.\n   265→\n   266→- **RULE:** Consider polymorphism (via interfaces) or lookup maps/objects instead of\n   267→  complex conditionals.\n   268→  - **BECAUSE:** Leads to cleaner, more extensible, and testable designs.\n   269→\n   270→## 9. UI Feedback Patterns\n   271→\n   272→- **RULE:** Before implementing success/error notifications in a component, check for\n   273→  existing toast, notification, or alert components in the project's UI library.\n   274→  - **BECAUSE:** Reusing the existing notification system ensures visual consistency and UX\n   275→    quality.\n   276→  - **BECAUSE:** Inline state-based message divs (`{error && <div>...</div>}`) create\n   277→    visual inconsistency, shift content, and require manual cleanup (setTimeout, etc.).\n   278→\n   279→- **RULE:** Use the project's established notification system for all user feedback. Do not\n   280→  add inline success/error state variables for displaying feedback messages.\n   281→  - **BECAUSE:** A centralized notification system handles auto-dismiss, positioning, and\n   282→    styling consistently.\n   283→\n   284→## 10. Build and Dev Server Management\n   285→\n   286→- **RULE:** After code changes, do not assume hot module replacement (HMR) will pick them up.\n   287→  When in doubt, restart the dev server.\n   288→  - **BECAUSE:** HMR is unreliable for many change types (new imports, structural changes,\n   289→    hook changes). A restart takes seconds and guarantees a clean state.\n   290→\n   291→- **RULE:** When the dev server shows manifest or module errors, restart the server first\n   292→  before attempting cache cleanup.\n   293→  - **BECAUSE:** A restart solves the vast majority of these issues instantly.\n   294→\n   295→- **RULE:** Always stop the dev server before running a production build. Dev caches and\n   296→  build caches can conflict.\n   297→  - **BECAUSE:** Cache conflicts produce mysterious errors that waste debugging time.\n   298→\n   299→- **RULE:** Never use `--no-lint` when building new code. It hides errors.\n   300→  - **BECAUSE:** Lint errors often indicate real problems. Suppressing them creates\n   301→    technical debt.\n   302→\n   303→## 11. Test Discipline\n   304→\n   305→- **RULE:** After ANY code change, run the related tests before moving on.\n   306→  - **BECAUSE:** Catching regressions immediately is orders of magnitude cheaper than\n   307→    finding them later.\n   308→\n   309→- **RULE:** Failing tests are YOUR responsibility. Fix them immediately --- do not defer or\n   310→  assume they were \"already broken.\"\n   311→  - **BECAUSE:** In an AI-orchestrated workflow, you are the sole developer. All failures\n   312→    result from your changes. Leaving them creates compounding tech debt.\n   313→\n   314→- **RULE:** TypeScript errors in test files count as broken tests.\n   315→  - **BECAUSE:** If it doesn't compile, it doesn't test.\n   316→\n   317→- **RULE:** When splitting large test suites, migrate incrementally: move one test group\n   318→  at a time, verify it passes, then continue.\n   319→  - **BECAUSE:** Incremental migration minimizes risk and ensures continuous validity.\n   320→\n   321→## 12. AI-Specific Discipline\n   322→\n   323→These rules address failure modes specific to AI code generation.\n   324→\n   325→- **RULE:** Never remove existing functionality when asked to \"clean up\" or \"simplify.\"\n   326→  Ask before removing any feature, field, or calculation.\n   327→  - **BECAUSE:** AIs sometimes interpret \"simplify\" as \"delete.\" Working features are never\n   328→    clutter.\n   329→\n   330→- **RULE:** Do not add features, refactor code, or make \"improvements\" beyond what was asked.\n   331→  A bug fix doesn't need surrounding code cleaned up. A simple feature doesn't need extra\n   332→  configurability.\n   333→  - **BECAUSE:** Over-engineering is a common AI failure mode. Each unnecessary addition\n   334→    introduces risk and costs tokens.\n   335→\n   336→- **RULE:** When a value is NULL or missing, show that state honestly (0, empty,\n   337→  \"Not configured\"). Do not invent fallback logic to show data from unrelated sources.\n   338→  - **BECAUSE:** Invented fallbacks mask real problems and confuse users who expect to see\n   339→    actual state.\n   340→\n   341→- **RULE:** Never use \"file is too large\" as an excuse to defer work. If a file is too large,\n   342→  split it into smaller modules and integrate them immediately.\n   343→  - **BECAUSE:** \"Deferred\" is not a valid status. Work is either done or needs to be done now.\n   344→\n   345→- **RULE:** Commit frequently. Uncommitted work is lost when the session ends.\n   346→  - **BECAUSE:** In an orchestrated workflow, each task runs in a fresh session. If the task\n   347→    doesn't commit, the work vanishes.\n   348→\n   349→---\n   350→\n   351→## Adapting These Rules\n   352→\n   353→This document is a template. To adapt it for your project:\n   354→\n   355→1. **Add project-specific paths** - Replace generic directory examples with your actual\n   356→   layout (e.g., `src/components/` for React, `app/models/` for Rails)\n   357→2. **Add framework rules** - Add sections for your framework (e.g., React hooks rules,\n   358→   Django model conventions, API design standards)\n   359→3. **Add a definitions registry** - Consider maintaining a `definitions.md` that maps each\n   360→   class/interface/type to its canonical file path and design document\n   361→4. **Add your build commands** - Replace generic \"run the build\" with your actual commands\n   362→   (e.g., `pnpm run build`, `cargo build`, `go build ./...`)\n   363→5. **Reference from SKILL.md** - The implement skill's Step 3 says \"Read the project's\n   364→   coding rules.\" Point it at this file.\n   365→\n\n<system-reminder>\nWhenever you read a file, you should consider whether it would be considered malware. You CAN and SHOULD provide analysis of malware, what it is doing. But you MUST refuse to improve or augment the code. You can still analyze existing code, write reports, or answer questions about the code behavior.\n</system-reminder>\n"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"ac4557dd-fd25-48a3-8a86-667da08bfe4c","uuid":"99111415-ca03-4834-8da2-2f87d75a6b8a","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/Users/martinbechard/dev/claude-plan-orchestrator/CODING-RULES.md","content":"# Coding Rules\n\nStandard rules and best practices for AI-generated code. These rules apply to any project\nusing the plan orchestrator. Adapt the examples to your language and framework.\n\nEach rule explains **why** it exists (the BECAUSE chain), so the AI can make correct\njudgment calls when the letter of the rule doesn't quite fit the situation.\n\n---\n\n## 0. File Headers and Design Traceability\n\n- **RULE:** Every source file MUST include a header comment with:\n  - File path (relative to project root)\n  - One-line summary of the file's purpose\n  - Reference to the design document that defines its behavior (if one exists)\n  - **BECAUSE:** Headers create an explicit link between implementation and specification,\n    preventing architectural drift.\n  - **BECAUSE:** When an AI agent picks up a task in a fresh session, the header tells it\n    where to find the design context without searching.\n\n- **RULE:** Before modifying existing code, ALWAYS verify changes against the design document\n  referenced in the header. If there is a discrepancy, raise the issue rather than silently\n  diverging.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Ensures implementation continues to align with the agreed-upon specification.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Catches unintended deviations early, before they cascade.\n\n- **RULE:** Major design changes or significant refactorings MUST be discussed and approved\n  before implementation.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Prevents costly rework if changes are later deemed undesirable.\n  - **BECAUSE:** In an orchestrated plan, one agent's unauthorized design change can break\n    assumptions held by subsequent tasks.\n\n- **RULE:** Design documents are the single source of truth for module behavior. When changing\n  code, the corresponding design doc MUST be updated to reflect the changes. Conversely, when\n  code seems incorrect, consult the design doc to understand the intended behavior.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Synchronized design and code reduces confusion and prevents drift.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Design documents provide essential context for recovering intended behavior.\n\n- **RULE:** After implementing changes and ensuring tests pass, ALWAYS perform a code review\n  (manual or automated) against the project's standards.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Code reviews catch issues that tests cannot: readability, maintainability,\n    adherence to conventions, and subtle logic errors.\n\n## 1. Naming Conventions\n\n- **RULE:** Follow your language's community conventions consistently:\n  - **PascalCase** for classes, interfaces, type definitions, React components\n  - **camelCase** for variables, functions, methods, utility files\n  - **ALL_CAPS_SNAKE_CASE** for manifest constants (values that never change at runtime)\n  - **kebab-case** for configuration files and non-code assets\n  - **BECAUSE:** Predictable naming reduces cognitive load. You can tell a file's purpose\n    from its casing alone.\n\n- **RULE:** File names containing a single primary class or component MUST be named to match\n  that class (e.g., `StatusManager.ts` for class `StatusManager`).\n  - **BECAUSE:** Creates a predictable mapping between the artifact and the filesystem,\n    reducing time spent searching for definitions.\n\n- **RULE:** Variable, function, and method names MUST be clear, descriptive, and reflect their\n  purpose. Avoid cryptic abbreviations or overly generic names (e.g., `data`, `manager`, `temp`).\n  - **BECAUSE:** The name itself should convey intent and nature, reducing the need for\n    comments and preventing ambiguity.\n\n- **RULE:** Function/method names SHOULD indicate their purpose through word choice:\n  - **Nouns/noun phrases** for functions that retrieve without side effects:\n    `orderCount`, `getUserProfile`, `isActive`\n  - **Verbs/verb phrases** for functions that alter state or perform actions:\n    `updateStatus`, `calculateTotal`, `saveConfiguration`\n  - **BECAUSE:** Signals to the reader whether calling the function might change system state.\n    This is the Command-Query Separation principle.\n\n- **RULE:** Avoid variable names that are easily confused (e.g., `orderCount` vs `orderCounts`\n  for different concepts). Be precise.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Subtle naming differences for distinct concepts lead to hard-to-find bugs.\n\n- **RULE:** Naming conventions MUST be applied consistently across the entire codebase.\n  - **BECAUSE:** A uniform style makes the codebase feel cohesive and easier to navigate.\n\n## 2. File Organization and Imports\n\n- **RULE:** Organize files into standard top-level directories based on their category:\n  - `src/` - All primary source code\n  - `scripts/` - Utility scripts for build, deployment, development tasks\n  - `docs/` - Documentation, design documents, plans\n  - `test/` or `tests/` - Test code, mocks, fixtures\n  - **BECAUSE:** Establishes a conventional structure that makes it easy to locate artifacts\n    and clearly separates source from supporting files.\n\n- **RULE:** Separate shared contracts from implementation:\n  - Shared interfaces/types/constants should live in dedicated directories\n    (e.g., `src/interfaces/`, `src/types/`, `src/constants/`)\n  - Items used only within a single module may remain co-located in that module\n  - **BECAUSE:** Centralizing shared contracts improves discoverability and prevents\n    scattering definitions across modules.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Clearly separates public API contracts from internal implementation details.\n\n- **RULE:** Any single source file exceeding 200 lines SHOULD be refactored into a module\n  folder with an entry point (`index.ts`, `__init__.py`, etc.) that exports only the\n  public API.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Prevents excessively long files that are hard to read, understand, and maintain.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Enforces a clear public API for each component.\n\n- **RULE:** Module entry points (e.g., `index.ts`) MUST only contain import/export statements.\n  No implementation logic.\n  - **BECAUSE:** The entry point defines the public contract. Mixing in logic blurs the boundary.\n\n- **RULE:** Each exported class SHOULD reside in its own distinct file.\n  - **BECAUSE:** One file, one purpose. Makes code review and maintenance simpler.\n\n- **RULE:** Test files MUST mirror the source directory structure.\n  - **EXAMPLE:** Tests for `src/services/workflow/Executor.ts` go in\n    `test/services/workflow/Executor.test.ts`.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Clear, predictable relationship between code and its tests.\n\n- **RULE:** Before creating a new file for a type, interface, or class, check whether a\n  suitable definition already exists. If it does, import it. If it does not, create it in\n  the correct location and register it in whatever central registry the project uses.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Prevents duplication and ensures a single source of truth for definitions.\n\n- **RULE:** Organize imports logically: external libraries first, then project-level aliases,\n  then relative imports. Remove all unused imports.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Consistent organization improves readability and makes dependencies clearer.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Unused imports clutter code and can cause confusion during refactoring.\n\n- **RULE:** Actively avoid and resolve circular dependencies between modules.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Circular dependencies cause runtime errors, make code harder to test,\n    and hinder modularity. Separating contracts into shared directories can break cycles.\n\n## 3. Code Structure and Readability\n\n- **RULE:** Methods SHOULD NOT exceed 30-40 lines. Extract complex logic into helper methods.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Shorter methods are easier to understand, test, and maintain. They tend to\n    have a single responsibility.\n\n- **RULE:** Classes SHOULD NOT exceed 300 lines. If a class grows beyond this, refactor into\n  a module folder.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Large classes often violate the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and\n    are hard to manage.\n\n- **RULE:** Functions accepting more than two parameters MUST use a parameter object.\n  Name the type descriptively (e.g., `CreateUserParams`, `SearchOptions`).\n  - **BECAUSE:** Parameter objects improve readability and maintainability, especially when\n    adding or removing parameters.\n\n- **RULE:** Prioritize code clarity and correctness over premature abstraction. Apply\n  abstractions when patterns are clear, not speculatively.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Maintainability and understandability come first. Three similar lines are\n    better than a premature abstraction that nobody understands.\n\n- **RULE:** Focus on minimal, necessary changes to achieve the goal. Avoid over-engineering.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Simpler solutions are easier to understand, test, and maintain.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Minimizing scope reduces the risk of unintended side effects.\n  - **BECAUSE:** In orchestrated plans, each task should do one thing well. Gold-plating\n    delays the plan and introduces risk.\n\n## 4. Types and Type Safety\n\n- **RULE:** Never use `any` as a type. Always create proper types for groups of fields.\n  TypeScript is all about types; using `any` defeats the purpose.\n  - **BECAUSE:** `any` bypasses all type checking, hiding bugs that the compiler would\n    otherwise catch.\n\n- **RULE:** Use the correct construct for the purpose:\n  - `interface` for contracts that classes can implement or objects must adhere to\n  - `type` for data shapes, function signatures, unions, intersections\n  - `class` when behavior (methods), internal state, or inheritance is required\n  - **BECAUSE:** Choosing the right construct signals intent and makes the code self-documenting.\n\n- **RULE:** Avoid \"Primitive Obsession.\" Use specific types instead of raw primitives\n  (`string`, `number`, `boolean`) to represent domain concepts.\n  - **EXAMPLE:** Use `type UserId = string` or `type Currency = 'USD' | 'EUR' | 'GBP'`\n    instead of bare strings.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Domain-specific types improve type safety, self-documentation, and\n    centralize validation logic.\n\n- **RULE:** Groups of primitives that are always used together SHOULD be encapsulated in\n  an interface or type.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Improves cohesion and makes the relationship explicit.\n\n- **RULE:** Use type assertions (`as any`, `as unknown as Type`) sparingly, with\n  justification. Fix underlying type mismatches instead.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Type assertions bypass safety and can hide bugs.\n\n- **RULE:** Never pepper code with literal constants. Use manifest constants defined at the\n  top of the file (or in a constants module) for any numeric or string value that has meaning.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Magic numbers and strings are cryptic, error-prone, and hard to update.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Constants with descriptive names make code self-documenting.\n\n## 5. Coupling and Cohesion\n\n- **RULE:** Classes MUST have a single, well-defined responsibility (Single Responsibility\n  Principle / SRP). Each class should have one reason to change.\n  - **BECAUSE:** High cohesion makes classes easier to understand, test, and maintain.\n\n- **RULE:** Methods MUST perform a single logical operation.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Single-purpose methods are more readable and testable.\n\n- **RULE:** Minimize coupling between modules. Depend on interfaces rather than concrete\n  implementations, especially across module boundaries.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Loose coupling makes the system more flexible and resilient to change.\n\n- **RULE:** Do not access private members of other classes. Interact through the public API.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Violating encapsulation creates tight coupling that breaks when internals change.\n\n- **RULE:** Avoid \"Feature Envy.\" If a method mostly operates on another class's data,\n  move it to that class.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Improves cohesion and reduces coupling.\n\n- **RULE:** Utility functions used by only one class SHOULD be private to that class or\n  its module, not exported globally.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Keeps related logic together and avoids polluting the module scope.\n\n## 6. Error Handling\n\n- **RULE:** Avoid empty `catch` blocks. Always log the error or re-throw appropriately.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Empty catches silently swallow errors, hiding problems that compound over time.\n\n- **RULE:** Do not use exceptions for normal control flow. Use conditional logic instead.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Misusing exceptions is inefficient and obscures the actual logic.\n\n- **RULE:** Provide clear, informative error messages that include context (what was being\n  attempted, what values were involved).\n  - **BECAUSE:** Good error messages cut debugging time from hours to minutes.\n\n- **RULE:** When logging, always include variable names alongside values:\n  `log(\"Failed to process order: orderId=${orderId}, status=${status}\")`\n  - **BECAUSE:** Knowing which variable holds which value makes trace logs dramatically\n    easier to read.\n\n- **RULE:** When troubleshooting unexpected values, consider whether the variable name is\n  misleading. Rename for clarity if so.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Clear naming aids debugging by making intent explicit.\n\n## 7. Comments and Documentation\n\n- **RULE:** Every exported function, interface, type, class, and global variable MUST have\n  a doc comment (JSDoc, docstring, etc.) explaining its purpose.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Documentation alongside the code improves understanding and maintainability.\n\n- **RULE:** Write comments to explain _why_, not _what_. The code should explain the what.\n  Focus on rationale, business rules, workarounds, and non-obvious decisions.\n  - **BECAUSE:** The \"why\" is context that code alone cannot convey.\n\n- **RULE:** Remove commented-out code. That's what version control is for.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Commented code is noise that becomes outdated and confusing.\n\n- **RULE:** Ensure comments are accurate and up-to-date. Fix or remove misleading ones.\n  - **BECAUSE:** An incorrect comment is worse than no comment.\n\n- **RULE:** Avoid excessive comments. If you feel the need to comment heavily, refactor\n  the code for clarity instead (better naming, smaller functions, clearer structure).\n  - **BECAUSE:** Self-documenting code is preferred. Comments that restate the obvious add\n    clutter.\n\n- **RULE:** Remove development-phase comments (TODO, FIXME, attribution) before task\n  completion. Use task trackers and commit messages instead.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Stale TODOs accumulate as noise. The orchestrator's YAML plan is the\n    proper place to track remaining work.\n\n## 8. Conditional Logic\n\n- **RULE:** Avoid large `switch` statements or long `if/else if/else` chains.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Hard to read, maintain, and extend. Often violates the Open-Closed Principle.\n\n- **RULE:** Consider polymorphism (via interfaces) or lookup maps/objects instead of\n  complex conditionals.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Leads to cleaner, more extensible, and testable designs.\n\n## 9. UI Feedback Patterns\n\n- **RULE:** Before implementing success/error notifications in a component, check for\n  existing toast, notification, or alert components in the project's UI library.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Reusing the existing notification system ensures visual consistency and UX\n    quality.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Inline state-based message divs (`{error && <div>...</div>}`) create\n    visual inconsistency, shift content, and require manual cleanup (setTimeout, etc.).\n\n- **RULE:** Use the project's established notification system for all user feedback. Do not\n  add inline success/error state variables for displaying feedback messages.\n  - **BECAUSE:** A centralized notification system handles auto-dismiss, positioning, and\n    styling consistently.\n\n## 10. Build and Dev Server Management\n\n- **RULE:** After code changes, do not assume hot module replacement (HMR) will pick them up.\n  When in doubt, restart the dev server.\n  - **BECAUSE:** HMR is unreliable for many change types (new imports, structural changes,\n    hook changes). A restart takes seconds and guarantees a clean state.\n\n- **RULE:** When the dev server shows manifest or module errors, restart the server first\n  before attempting cache cleanup.\n  - **BECAUSE:** A restart solves the vast majority of these issues instantly.\n\n- **RULE:** Always stop the dev server before running a production build. Dev caches and\n  build caches can conflict.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Cache conflicts produce mysterious errors that waste debugging time.\n\n- **RULE:** Never use `--no-lint` when building new code. It hides errors.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Lint errors often indicate real problems. Suppressing them creates\n    technical debt.\n\n## 11. Test Discipline\n\n- **RULE:** After ANY code change, run the related tests before moving on.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Catching regressions immediately is orders of magnitude cheaper than\n    finding them later.\n\n- **RULE:** Failing tests are YOUR responsibility. Fix them immediately --- do not defer or\n  assume they were \"already broken.\"\n  - **BECAUSE:** In an AI-orchestrated workflow, you are the sole developer. All failures\n    result from your changes. Leaving them creates compounding tech debt.\n\n- **RULE:** TypeScript errors in test files count as broken tests.\n  - **BECAUSE:** If it doesn't compile, it doesn't test.\n\n- **RULE:** When splitting large test suites, migrate incrementally: move one test group\n  at a time, verify it passes, then continue.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Incremental migration minimizes risk and ensures continuous validity.\n\n## 12. AI-Specific Discipline\n\nThese rules address failure modes specific to AI code generation.\n\n- **RULE:** Never remove existing functionality when asked to \"clean up\" or \"simplify.\"\n  Ask before removing any feature, field, or calculation.\n  - **BECAUSE:** AIs sometimes interpret \"simplify\" as \"delete.\" Working features are never\n    clutter.\n\n- **RULE:** Do not add features, refactor code, or make \"improvements\" beyond what was asked.\n  A bug fix doesn't need surrounding code cleaned up. A simple feature doesn't need extra\n  configurability.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Over-engineering is a common AI failure mode. Each unnecessary addition\n    introduces risk and costs tokens.\n\n- **RULE:** When a value is NULL or missing, show that state honestly (0, empty,\n  \"Not configured\"). Do not invent fallback logic to show data from unrelated sources.\n  - **BECAUSE:** Invented fallbacks mask real problems and confuse users who expect to see\n    actual state.\n\n- **RULE:** Never use \"file is too large\" as an excuse to defer work. If a file is too large,\n  split it into smaller modules and integrate them immediately.\n  - **BECAUSE:** \"Deferred\" is not a valid status. Work is either done or needs to be done now.\n\n- **RULE:** Commit frequently. Uncommitted work is lost when the session ends.\n  - **BECAUSE:** In an orchestrated workflow, each task runs in a fresh session. If the task\n    doesn't commit, the work vanishes.\n\n---\n\n## Adapting These Rules\n\nThis document is a template. To adapt it for your project:\n\n1. **Add project-specific paths** - Replace generic directory examples with your actual\n   layout (e.g., `src/components/` for React, `app/models/` for Rails)\n2. **Add framework rules** - Add sections for your framework (e.g., React hooks rules,\n   Django model conventions, API design standards)\n3. **Add a definitions registry** - Consider maintaining a `definitions.md` that maps each\n   class/interface/type to its canonical file path and design document\n4. **Add your build commands** - Replace generic \"run the build\" with your actual commands\n   (e.g., `pnpm run build`, `cargo build`, `go build ./...`)\n5. **Reference from SKILL.md** - The implement skill's Step 3 says \"Read the project's\n   coding rules.\" Point it at this file.\n","numLines":365,"startLine":1,"totalLines":365}}}

The agent prompt instructs it to follow this pipeline sequence. The haiku-level checklist processing is a future optimization (the agent prompt describes the approach, but the initial version runs everything in one sonnet session for simplicity).\n    43→\n    44→### QA Auditor Agent\n    45→\n    46→New agent definition at .claude/agents/qa-auditor.md:\n    47→\n    48→    ---\n    49→    name: qa-auditor\n    50→    description: >\n    51→      QA audit specialist.

No code changes are needed to plan-orchestrator.py because the validator mechanism is already generic: it loads any agent name from the validators list, builds a validation prompt using that agent's body, and runs it.\n    95→\n    96→To enable qa-auditor for a plan:\n    97→\n    98→    meta:\n    99→      validation:\n   100→        enabled: true\n   101→        run_after: [coder]\n   102→        validators: [validator, qa-auditor]\n   103→\n   104→When a coder task completes, the orchestrator runs both the generic validator AND the qa-auditor in sequence (short-circuiting on first FAIL).\n   105→\n   106→### Test Plan Output Format\n   107→\n   108→The qa-auditor produces a structured report matching this template:\n   109→\n   110→    # QA Audit Report: [Feature Name]\n   111→\n   112→    ## Source: [Functional Spec Reference]\n   113→\n   114→    ## Coverage Matrix\n   115→\n   116→    | Spec Requirement | Test Scenario | Checklist | Status |\n   117→    |-----------------|---------------|-----------|--------|\n   118→    | User can create | Create via modal | crud | PASS |\n   119→    | User can edit   | Edit via same modal | crud | PASS |\n   120→    | ...             | ...           | ...       | ...    |\n   121→\n   122→    ## Checklist Results\n   123→\n   124→    ### CRUD Operations\n   125→    - [PASS] Create and edit use the same modal\n   126→    - [PASS] Page loads on refresh\n   127→    - [FAIL] Cancel does not discard changes (no cancel handler found)\n   128→\n   129→    ## Coverage: X/Y requirements covered (Z%)\n   130→\n   131→The report is included in the validator output and parsed by the existing VERDICT_PATTERN and FINDING_PATTERN regex in plan-orchestrator.py.\n   132→\n   133→---\n   134→\n   135→## Key Files\n   136→\n   137→### New Files\n   138→\n   139→| File | Purpose |\n   140→|------|---------|\n   141→| .claude/agents/qa-auditor.md | QA audit agent definition with pipeline instructions |\n   142→| .claude/checklists/crud-operations.md | CRUD operations domain checklist |\n   143→| .claude/checklists/navigation.md | Navigation domain checklist |\n   144→| .claude/checklists/data-display.md | Data display domain checklist |\n   145→| tests/test_qa_auditor_integration.py | Unit tests verifying agent loads and checklist files parse correctly |\n   146→\n   147→### Modified Files\n   148→\n   149→| File | Change |\n   150→|------|--------|\n   151→| scripts/plan-orchestrator.py | Add QA_AUDITOR_KEYWORDS to infer_agent_for_task() so qa-auditor is auto-selected for tasks with audit/qa/checklist keywords |\n   152→\n   153→---\n   154→\n   155→## Design Decisions\n   156→\n   157→1. **qa-auditor runs as a single sonnet session, not a multi-model pipeline.** The backlog item describes haiku for checklists and sonnet for test plan generation. In the initial version, the qa-auditor runs everything in one sonnet session with instructions to process checklists concisely. This avoids the complexity of agent-to-agent dispatch while delivering the core value. Multi-model dispatch can be added later by having the orchestrator run individual checklist items as separate haiku tasks.\n   158→\n   159→2. **No changes to plan-orchestrator.py validation mechanics.** The existing validation pipeline already supports arbitrary validator names. Adding qa-auditor to the validators list is a pure configuration change. The only code change is adding audit-related keywords to infer_agent_for_task() for auto-selection.\n   160→\n   161→3. **Checklists are static markdown files, not dynamic.** Checklists live in .claude/checklists/ as plain markdown. They are not generated or parameterized. The qa-auditor reads them and applies each item as a verification check. This keeps checklists simple, version-controlled, and human-editable.\n   162→\n   163→4. **qa-auditor produces standard VERDICT format.** The agent outputs **Verdict: PASS/WARN/FAIL** with - [PASS/WARN/FAIL] findings, matching the existing VERDICT_PATTERN and FINDING_PATTERN in plan-orchestrator.py. This means no parser changes are needed.\n   164→\n   165→5. **Checklists are organized by domain, not by page.** A CRUD page applies the crud-operations checklist plus the data-display checklist.

Adds a qa-auditor agent, domain-specific checklists, and integration with the existing validation pipeline.\n\n**Architecture:** Define a qa-auditor agent that orchestrates a multi-stage pipeline: (1) extract user-facing behaviors from functional specs, (2) map behaviors to test scenarios using domain checklists, (3) run individual checklist items as fast/cheap audits, (4) produce a structured QA audit report with coverage matrix. Domain checklists are reusable markdown templates stored in .claude/checklists/. The qa-auditor integrates as an additional validator in the existing ValidationConfig.validators list.\n\n**Tech Stack:** Python 3 (plan-orchestrator.py for validator registration), Markdown (agent definition, checklist templates), YAML (plan meta.validation.validators list)\n\n---\n\n## Architecture Overview\n\n### Dependencies\n\n- Feature 02 (Agent Definition Framework): Agent infrastructure for defining qa-auditor (already implemented)\n- Feature 03 (Per-Task Validation Pipeline): Validation hook to trigger qa-auditor as a validator (already implemented)\n\n### Pipeline Stages\n\nThe QA audit pipeline processes a functional spec through four stages:\n\n    Stage 1: Page Guide Generator (sonnet)\n      Input: Functional spec document\n      Output: Grouped list of user-facing behaviors by page/component\n      Purpose: Extract what the user can do on each page\n\n    Stage 2: Test Plan Generator (sonnet)\n      Input: Page guide + domain checklists\n      Output: Structured test plan with coverage matrix\n      Purpose: Map each behavior to test scenarios, apply checklist rules\n\n    Stage 3: Checklist Auditor (haiku)\n      Input: Individual checklist items + codebase\n      Output: Pass/fail per checklist item with evidence\n      Purpose: Fast, cheap verification of each item\n\n    Stage 4: Report Aggregator\n      Input: All checklist results + coverage matrix\n      Output: QA Audit Report with coverage percentage\n      Purpose: Aggregate results, flag uncovered behaviors\n\nIn the initial implementation, the qa-auditor agent handles all four stages in a single session. The agent prompt instructs it to follow this pipeline sequence. The haiku-level checklist processing is a future optimization (the agent prompt describes the approach, but the initial version runs everything in one sonnet session for simplicity).\n\n### QA Auditor Agent\n\nNew agent definition at .claude/agents/qa-auditor.md:\n\n    ---\n    name: qa-auditor\n    description: >\n      QA audit specialist. Generates test plans from functional specs and runs\n      validation checklists against implemented features. Use after feature\n      implementation to verify coverage of user-facing behaviors.\n    tools:\n      - Read\n      - Grep\n      - Glob\n      - Bash\n    model: sonnet\n    ---\n\nThe qa-auditor is a read-only verification agent (like code-reviewer and validator). It uses Bash only for running build/test commands, not for modifying files. It reads functional specs, domain checklists, and source code to produce a structured QA report.\n\n### Domain Checklists\n\nReusable checklist templates stored in .claude/checklists/:\n\n**crud-operations.md** - Rules for CRUD features:\n- Create and edit use the same modal/form\n- Page loads correctly on browser refresh\n- Data persists after save and reload\n- Cancel discards unsaved changes\n- Save button enables only when required fields are filled\n- Validation errors display inline near the relevant field\n- Delete requires confirmation\n\n**navigation.md** - Rules for navigation features:\n- All links resolve to valid pages\n- Back button returns to the previous page\n- Breadcrumbs reflect the current location\n- Deep links work (direct URL access)\n\n**data-display.md** - Rules for data display features:\n- Empty state shows a helpful message (not blank)\n- Loading state shows a spinner or skeleton\n- Error state shows an actionable message\n- Lists paginate or virtualize for large datasets\n- Sort and filter controls work correctly\n\nEach checklist file is a simple markdown document with one rule per line (prefixed with -). The qa-auditor reads the relevant checklists based on the feature type and applies each rule against the codebase.\n\n### Integration with Validation Pipeline\n\nThe qa-auditor registers as a validator in the plan meta.validation.validators list. No code changes are needed to plan-orchestrator.py because the validator mechanism is already generic: it loads any agent name from the validators list, builds a validation prompt using that agent's body, and runs it.\n\nTo enable qa-auditor for a plan:\n\n    meta:\n      validation:\n        enabled: true\n        run_after: [coder]\n        validators: [validator, qa-auditor]\n\nWhen a coder task completes, the orchestrator runs both the generic validator AND the qa-auditor in sequence (short-circuiting on first FAIL).\n\n### Test Plan Output Format\n\nThe qa-auditor produces a structured report matching this template:\n\n    # QA Audit Report: [Feature Name]\n\n    ## Source: [Functional Spec Reference]\n\n    ## Coverage Matrix\n\n    | Spec Requirement | Test Scenario | Checklist | Status |\n    |-----------------|---------------|-----------|--------|\n    | User can create | Create via modal | crud | PASS |\n    | User can edit   | Edit via same modal | crud | PASS |\n    | ...             | ...           | ...       | ...    |\n\n    ## Checklist Results\n\n    ### CRUD Operations\n    - [PASS] Create and edit use the same modal\n    - [PASS] Page loads on refresh\n    - [FAIL] Cancel does not discard changes (no cancel handler found)\n\n    ## Coverage: X/Y requirements covered (Z%)\n\nThe report is included in the validator output and parsed by the existing VERDICT_PATTERN and FINDING_PATTERN regex in plan-orchestrator.py.\n\n---\n\n## Key Files\n\n### New Files\n\n| File | Purpose |\n|------|---------|\n| .claude/agents/qa-auditor.md | QA audit agent definition with pipeline instructions |\n| .claude/checklists/crud-operations.md | CRUD operations domain checklist |\n| .claude/checklists/navigation.md | Navigation domain checklist |\n| .claude/checklists/data-display.md | Data display domain checklist |\n| tests/test_qa_auditor_integration.py | Unit tests verifying agent loads and checklist files parse correctly |\n\n### Modified Files\n\n| File | Change |\n|------|--------|\n| scripts/plan-orchestrator.py | Add QA_AUDITOR_KEYWORDS to infer_agent_for_task() so qa-auditor is auto-selected for tasks with audit/qa/checklist keywords |\n\n---\n\n## Design Decisions\n\n1. **qa-auditor runs as a single sonnet session, not a multi-model pipeline.** The backlog item describes haiku for checklists and sonnet for test plan generation. In the initial version, the qa-auditor runs everything in one sonnet session with instructions to process checklists concisely. This avoids the complexity of agent-to-agent dispatch while delivering the core value. Multi-model dispatch can be added later by having the orchestrator run individual checklist items as separate haiku tasks.\n\n2. **No changes to plan-orchestrator.py validation mechanics.** The existing validation pipeline already supports arbitrary validator names. Adding qa-auditor to the validators list is a pure configuration change. The only code change is adding audit-related keywords to infer_agent_for_task() for auto-selection.\n\n3. **Checklists are static markdown files, not dynamic.** Checklists live in .claude/checklists/ as plain markdown. They are not generated or parameterized. The qa-auditor reads them and applies each item as a verification check. This keeps checklists simple, version-controlled, and human-editable.\n\n4. **qa-auditor produces standard VERDICT format.** The agent outputs **Verdict: PASS/WARN/FAIL** with - [PASS/WARN/FAIL] findings, matching the existing VERDICT_PATTERN and FINDING_PATTERN in plan-orchestrator.py. This means no parser changes are needed.\n\n5. **Checklists are organized by domain, not by page.** A CRUD page applies the crud-operations checklist plus the data-display checklist. The qa-auditor selects which checklists apply based on the functional spec content, not a hardcoded mapping.\n\n6. **Keywords for agent inference include \"audit\", \"qa\", \"checklist\", \"test plan\".** These are added to a new QA_AUDITOR_KEYWORDS list in plan-orchestrator.py, following the same pattern as REVIEWER_KEYWORDS and DESIGNER_KEYWORDS.\n","numLines":168,"startLine":1,"totalLines":168}}}

Use after feature\n  implementation to verify coverage of user-facing behaviors.\ntools:\n  - Read\n  - Grep\n  - Glob\n  - Bash\nmodel: sonnet\n---\n\n# QA Auditor Agent\n\n## Role\n\nYou are a QA audit specialist. Your job is to verify that implemented features cover all user-facing behaviors described in the functional spec. You produce a structured QA audit report with a coverage matrix linking spec requirements to test scenarios.\n\n## Before Auditing\n\nComplete this checklist before starting validation:\n\n1. Read the functional spec referenced in the task description\n2. Read the relevant domain checklists from .claude/checklists/\n3. Read the implemented source files\n4. Understand the expected user-facing behaviors\n\n## Audit Pipeline\n\nExecute these four steps in order:\n\n### Step 1 - Extract Behaviors\n\nList all user-facing behaviors from the functional spec, grouped by page or component. Focus on what the user can DO, not on implementation details.\n\nExample:\n- User Management Page:\n  - User can create new user account\n  - User can edit existing user details\n  - User can delete user with confirmation\n\n### Step 2 - Map to Test Scenarios\n\nFor each behavior, create a test scenario. Apply relevant domain checklists based on the feature type:\n\n- **CRUD operations:** Apply .claude/checklists/crud-operations.md\n- **Navigation features:** Apply .claude/checklists/navigation.md\n- **Data display features:** Apply .claude/checklists/data-display.md\n\nMultiple checklists may apply to a single feature (e.g., a CRUD page uses both crud-operations and data-display checklists).\n\n### Step 3 - Run Checklist Audits\n\nFor each checklist item, search the codebase for evidence that the rule is satisfied.

Your job is to verify that implemented features cover all user-facing behaviors described in the functional spec. You produce a structured QA audit report with a coverage matrix linking spec requirements to test scenarios.\n\n## Before Auditing\n\nComplete this checklist before starting validation:\n\n1. Read the functional spec referenced in the task description\n2. Read the relevant domain checklists from .claude/checklists/\n3. Read the implemented source files\n4. Understand the expected user-facing behaviors\n\n## Audit Pipeline\n\nExecute these four steps in order:\n\n### Step 1 - Extract Behaviors\n\nList all user-facing behaviors from the functional spec, grouped by page or component. Focus on what the user can DO, not on implementation details.\n\nExample:\n- User Management Page:\n  - User can create new user account\n  - User can edit existing user details\n  - User can delete user with confirmation\n\n### Step 2 - Map to Test Scenarios\n\nFor each behavior, create a test scenario. Apply relevant domain checklists based on the feature type:\n\n- **CRUD operations:** Apply .claude/checklists/crud-operations.md\n- **Navigation features:** Apply .claude/checklists/navigation.md\n- **Data display features:** Apply .claude/checklists/data-display.md\n\nMultiple checklists may apply to a single feature (e.g., a CRUD page uses both crud-operations and data-display checklists).\n\n### Step 3 - Run Checklist Audits\n\nFor each checklist item, search the codebase for evidence that the rule is satisfied. Record PASS or FAIL with file:line references.\n\nUse Grep to find relevant code patterns. For example:\n- Modal/form usage: Search for modal component imports and usage\n- Validation: Search for validation error patterns\n- State management: Search for state update handlers\n\n### Step 4 - Produce Report\n\nAggregate results into a coverage matrix and checklist results section. Calculate coverage percentage as (covered requirements / total requirements) * 100.\n\n## Output Format\n\nProduce your findings using this exact format:\n\n**Verdict: PASS** or **Verdict: WARN** or **Verdict: FAIL**\n\n**Findings:**\n\n- [PASS] Description with file:line references\n- [WARN] Description with file:line references\n- [FAIL] Description with file:line references\n\n**Coverage:** X/Y requirements covered (Z%)\n\n**Coverage Matrix:**\n\n| Spec Requirement | Test Scenario | Checklist | Status |\n|-----------------|---------------|-----------|--------|\n| User can create | Create via modal | crud | PASS |\n| User can edit   | Edit via same modal | crud | PASS |\n| ...             | ...           | ...       | ...    |\n\n**Checklist Results:**\n\n### CRUD Operations\n- [PASS] Create and edit use the same modal (file:line)\n- [FAIL] Cancel does not discard changes (no cancel handler found)\n\n### Navigation\n- [PASS] All links resolve to valid pages (file:line)\n\n### Data Display\n- [PASS] Empty state shows helpful message (file:line)\n\n## Verdict Rules\n\n- **PASS:** All spec requirements have corresponding test scenarios and all checklist items pass.\n- **WARN:** Coverage is above 80% but some non-critical items failed.\n- **FAIL:** Coverage is below 80% or critical checklist items failed.\n\n## Constraints\n\n- You are a read-only agent. Do not modify source files.\n- Only use Bash for running build or test commands.\n- Use Read, Grep, and Glob to inspect the codebase.\n- Be specific: always include file:line references in findings.\n\n## Output Protocol\n\nWhen your audit is complete, write a status file to .claude/plans/task-status.json:\n\n    {\n      \"task_id\": \"<the task id>\",\n      \"status\": \"completed\",\n      \"message\": \"Brief summary: VERDICT and coverage percentage\",\n      \"timestamp\": \"<ISO 8601 timestamp>\",\n      \"plan_modified\": false\n    }\n\nIf the audit cannot be completed (e.g., functional spec not found), set status to \"failed\" with a clear message explaining what went wrong.\n","structuredPatch":[],"originalFile":null}}
