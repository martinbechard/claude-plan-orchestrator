{"type":"user","message":{"role":"user","content":[{"type":"text","text":"Base directory for this skill: /Users/martinbechard/dev/claude-plan-orchestrator/.claude/skills/coding-rules\n\n# Coding Rules (Summary)\n\nThis skill provides a condensed overview of the project's coding standards. Each section\nbelow summarizes a rule category. For the full rules with rationale (the BECAUSE chains)\nand examples, read **CODING-RULES.md** at the project root.\n\n## Rule 0: File Headers and Design Traceability\n\nEvery source file must include a header comment with the file path, a one-line purpose\nsummary, and a reference to the relevant design document. Before modifying code, verify\nchanges against the design document referenced in the header. Design documents are the\nsingle source of truth for module behavior; keep them synchronized with the code.\n\n## Rule 1: Naming Conventions\n\nUse PascalCase for classes, interfaces, types, and React components. Use camelCase for\nvariables, functions, methods, and utility files. Use ALL_CAPS_SNAKE_CASE for manifest\nconstants. Use kebab-case for configuration files. File names must match their primary\nclass or component. Names must be clear, descriptive, and follow Command-Query Separation\n(nouns for queries, verbs for mutations).\n\n## Rule 2: File Organization and Imports\n\nOrganize files into standard directories (src/, scripts/, docs/, tests/). Separate shared\ncontracts (interfaces, types, constants) from implementation. Files exceeding 200 lines\nshould be refactored into a module folder with an entry point that exports only the public\nAPI. Entry points must contain only import/export statements. Organize imports as: external\nlibraries, project aliases, relative imports. Remove unused imports. Avoid circular\ndependencies.\n\n## Rule 3: Code Structure and Readability\n\nMethods should not exceed 30-40 lines; extract complex logic into helpers. Classes should\nnot exceed 300 lines. Functions with more than two parameters must use a parameter object.\nPrioritize code clarity over premature abstraction. Focus on minimal, necessary changes;\navoid over-engineering.\n\n## Rule 4: Type Safety\n\nNever use the any type; create proper typed interfaces. Use interface for contracts, type\nfor data shapes and unions, class when behavior or state is required. Avoid primitive\nobsession; use domain-specific types. Never use literal magic numbers or strings; define\nmanifest constants at the top of the file or in a constants module.\n\n## Rule 5: Coupling and Cohesion\n\nClasses must have a single responsibility (SRP). Methods must perform a single logical\noperation. Depend on interfaces rather than concrete implementations. Do not access private\nmembers of other classes. Avoid Feature Envy (move methods to where the data lives).\nUtility functions used by only one class should be private to that class.\n\n## Rule 6: Error Handling\n\nNever use empty catch blocks; always log or re-throw. Do not use exceptions for control\nflow. Provide clear error messages with context (what was attempted, which values were\ninvolved). Include variable names alongside values in log statements.\n\n## Rule 7: Comments and Documentation\n\nEvery exported symbol must have a doc comment explaining its purpose. Write comments to\nexplain why, not what. Remove commented-out code (use version control). Keep comments\naccurate and up-to-date. Avoid excessive comments; refactor for clarity instead. Remove\nTODO/FIXME comments before task completion; use the YAML plan to track remaining work.\n\n## Rule 11: Test Discipline\n\nRun related tests after any code change. Failing tests are your responsibility; fix them\nimmediately. TypeScript errors in test files count as broken tests. When splitting large\ntest suites, migrate incrementally (one group at a time, verify, continue).\n\n## Rule 12: AI-Specific Discipline\n\nNever remove existing functionality when asked to simplify. Do not add features or\nimprovements beyond what was asked. Show actual state honestly (null, empty, not configured);\nnever invent fallback data.

The pragmatic approach is a user-configured ceiling combined with locally-tracked cost. This is simple, requires no API access, and works across all plan types.\n   211→\n   212→2. **BudgetGuard wraps PlanUsageTracker, not a separate cost counter.** Instead of maintaining its own running cost total, BudgetGuard queries PlanUsageTracker.get_total_usage().total_cost_usd directly. This avoids duplicate state and keeps cost data in one authoritative place.\n   213→\n   214→3. **BudgetGuard is separate from CircuitBreaker.** The circuit breaker handles task failures and rate limits. The budget guard handles cost thresholds. These are orthogonal concerns and should not be merged.\n   215→\n   216→4. **CLI flags override plan YAML.** This lets users run the same plan with different budgets (e.g., more conservative overnight). The plan YAML provides defaults, the CLI provides overrides.\n   217→\n   218→5. **Pause, don't fail.** Budget exhaustion is a normal operational condition, not an error. The plan is paused, not failed, and can be resumed when more budget is available. Exit code 0 signals this.\n   219→\n   220→6. **Session-scoped spending, not weekly aggregation.** Tracking weekly spending across sessions would require reading all historical usage reports and summing them for the current billing week. This adds complexity (billing cycle detection, timezone handling). The MVP tracks spending within a single orchestrator run or pipeline session. Users can set their ceiling to account for prior spending manually.\n   221→\n   222→7. **BudgetConfig and BudgetGuard live in plan-orchestrator.py.** Following the single-file convention established by TaskResult, CircuitBreaker, and PlanUsageTracker.\n   223→\n   224→8. **No cost estimation or prediction.** The \"nice to have\" cost estimation from the backlog item is deferred. Predicting task cost requires historical data that does not yet exist. The MVP checks \"have we spent too much?\" before each task.\n   225→"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"273d8aa0-acf6-4cc1-b0ac-b801eb2e19d3","uuid":"0871397e-d733-497a-b27e-663c06e6fb3f","tool_use_result":{"type":"text","file":{"filePath":"/Users/martinbechard/dev/claude-plan-orchestrator/docs/plans/2026-02-14-07-quota-aware-execution-design.md","content":"# Quota-Aware Execution with Weekly Budget Limits - Design Document\n\n**Goal:** Add budget awareness to the orchestrator and auto-pipeline so they can stop gracefully before exhausting the user's weekly Claude usage quota, reserving a configurable portion for interactive use.\n\n**Architecture:** Add a BudgetConfig dataclass to hold budget limits parsed from plan YAML meta or CLI flags.

It does not maintain its own cost counter; it queries the tracker directly.\n\n    class BudgetGuard:\n        \"\"\"Checks cumulative cost against budget limits before each task.\"\"\"\n\n        def __init__(self, config: BudgetConfig, usage_tracker: PlanUsageTracker):\n            self.config = config\n            self.usage_tracker = usage_tracker\n\n        def can_proceed(self) -> tuple[bool, str]:\n            \"\"\"Check if budget allows another task.\n            Returns (can_proceed, reason_if_not).\n            \"\"\"\n            if not self.config.is_enabled:\n                return (True, \"\")\n            total = self.usage_tracker.get_total_usage()\n            spent = total.total_cost_usd\n            limit = self.config.effective_limit_usd\n            if spent >= limit:\n                pct = (spent / self.config.quota_ceiling_usd * 100) if self.config.quota_ceiling_usd > 0 else 0\n                reason = (\n                    f\"Budget limit reached: ${spent:.4f} / ${limit:.4f} \"\n                    f\"({pct:.1f}% of ${self.config.quota_ceiling_usd:.2f} ceiling)\"\n                )\n                return (False, reason)\n            return (True, \"\")\n\n        def get_usage_percent(self) -> float:\n            \"\"\"Current spending as percentage of ceiling.\"\"\"\n            if not self.config.is_enabled:\n                return 0.0\n            total = self.usage_tracker.get_total_usage()\n            return (total.total_cost_usd / self.config.quota_ceiling_usd * 100)\n\n        def format_status(self) -> str:\n            \"\"\"Format current budget status for display.\"\"\"\n            if not self.config.is_enabled:\n                return \"[Budget: unlimited]\"\n            total = self.usage_tracker.get_total_usage()\n            spent = total.total_cost_usd\n            limit = self.config.effective_limit_usd\n            pct = self.get_usage_percent()\n            return f\"[Budget: ${spent:.4f} / ${limit:.4f} ({pct:.1f}% of ceiling)]\"\n\nThe guard returns a tuple so the caller gets both the decision and a human-readable explanation.\n\n### Plan YAML Configuration\n\nBudget settings in the plan meta block:\n\n    meta:\n      name: My Feature\n      budget:\n        max_quota_percent: 90\n        quota_ceiling_usd: 100.00\n\nWhen no budget block is present, no budget enforcement occurs (backwards compatible).\n\n### CLI Flags\n\nNew orchestrator flags:\n\n    --max-budget-pct N       Maximum % of quota ceiling to use (default: 100)\n    --quota-ceiling N.NN     Weekly quota ceiling in USD (default: 0 = unlimited)\n    --reserved-budget N.NN   USD amount to reserve for interactive use (default: 0)\n\nCLI flags override plan YAML values when both are specified.\n\n### parse_budget_config Helper\n\nA helper function parses BudgetConfig from both the plan meta and CLI args:\n\n    def parse_budget_config(plan: dict, args: argparse.Namespace) -> BudgetConfig:\n        \"\"\"Parse budget configuration from plan YAML and CLI overrides.\"\"\"\n        budget_meta = plan.get(\"meta\", {}).get(\"budget\", {})\n        config = BudgetConfig(\n            max_quota_percent=budget_meta.get(\"max_quota_percent\", DEFAULT_MAX_QUOTA_PERCENT),\n            quota_ceiling_usd=budget_meta.get(\"quota_ceiling_usd\", DEFAULT_QUOTA_CEILING_USD),\n            reserved_budget_usd=budget_meta.get(\"reserved_budget_usd\", DEFAULT_RESERVED_BUDGET_USD),\n        )\n        # CLI overrides\n        if hasattr(args, 'max_budget_pct') and args.max_budget_pct is not None:\n            config.max_quota_percent = args.max_budget_pct\n        if hasattr(args, 'quota_ceiling') and args.quota_ceiling is not None:\n            config.quota_ceiling_usd = args.quota_ceiling\n        if hasattr(args, 'reserved_budget') and args.reserved_budget is not None:\n            config.reserved_budget_usd = args.reserved_budget\n        return config\n\n### Pre-Task Check in Orchestrator\n\nIn run_orchestrator(), after the existing circuit breaker check and before task execution:\n\n1. Call budget_guard.can_proceed()\n2. If False, print the reason, set meta.status to \"paused_quota\", save the plan, and break\n3. After each task completes, the usage is already recorded in usage_tracker (no extra step needed since BudgetGuard reads from it)\n\nThe check happens in the main task loop:\n- Sequential path (around line 2374, after circuit breaker check)\n- Parallel path (around line 2396, before parallel group execution)\n\n### Plan Pause Behavior\n\nWhen budget is exhausted:\n\n1. The current task completes (no mid-task interruption)\n2. Plan YAML is updated: meta.status becomes \"paused_quota\"\n3. A meta.pause_reason is written with the budget explanation\n4. The usage report is generated (from PlanUsageTracker)\n5. run_orchestrator() exits with code 0 (not a failure)\n\nA paused plan can be resumed later with --resume-from, and the budget guard re-evaluates from current spending.\n\n### Auto-Pipeline Integration\n\nThe auto-pipeline checks session-level spending across work items using SessionUsageTracker.total_cost_usd:\n\n1. Parse budget config from CLI flags (--max-budget-pct, --quota-ceiling)\n2. Create a PipelineBudgetGuard that checks SessionUsageTracker.total_cost_usd against the ceiling\n3. Before starting each new work item, check can_proceed()\n4. If budget exhausted, log the reason and break the main loop\n\nThe auto-pipeline budget check is per-work-item (coarser granularity than per-task).\n\n### Exit Codes\n\nThe orchestrator uses specific exit behavior for budget pauses:\n\n- Exit code 0: Plan paused due to budget (not a failure)\n- The auto-pipeline detects \"paused_quota\" in the plan YAML after execution\n- This is distinct from exit code 1 (real failure) and rate-limit retries\n\n---\n\n## Key Files\n\n### Modified Files\n\n| File | Change |\n|------|--------|\n| scripts/plan-orchestrator.py | BudgetConfig, BudgetGuard, parse_budget_config, pre-task check, CLI flags, plan pause logic |\n| scripts/auto-pipeline.py | PipelineBudgetGuard, per-work-item check, CLI flags |\n\n### New Files\n\n| File | Purpose |\n|------|---------|\n| tests/test_budget_guard.py | Unit tests for BudgetConfig, BudgetGuard, parse_budget_config |\n\n---\n\n## Design Decisions\n\n1. **User-configured ceiling, not API-queried quota.** There is no known programmatic API to query remaining Claude weekly quota. The pragmatic approach is a user-configured ceiling combined with locally-tracked cost. This is simple, requires no API access, and works across all plan types.\n\n2. **BudgetGuard wraps PlanUsageTracker, not a separate cost counter.** Instead of maintaining its own running cost total, BudgetGuard queries PlanUsageTracker.get_total_usage().total_cost_usd directly. This avoids duplicate state and keeps cost data in one authoritative place.\n\n3. **BudgetGuard is separate from CircuitBreaker.** The circuit breaker handles task failures and rate limits. The budget guard handles cost thresholds. These are orthogonal concerns and should not be merged.\n\n4. **CLI flags override plan YAML.** This lets users run the same plan with different budgets (e.g., more conservative overnight). The plan YAML provides defaults, the CLI provides overrides.\n\n5. **Pause, don't fail.** Budget exhaustion is a normal operational condition, not an error. The plan is paused, not failed, and can be resumed when more budget is available. Exit code 0 signals this.\n\n6. **Session-scoped spending, not weekly aggregation.** Tracking weekly spending across sessions would require reading all historical usage reports and summing them for the current billing week. This adds complexity (billing cycle detection, timezone handling). The MVP tracks spending within a single orchestrator run or pipeline session. Users can set their ceiling to account for prior spending manually.\n\n7. **BudgetConfig and BudgetGuard live in plan-orchestrator.py.** Following the single-file convention established by TaskResult, CircuitBreaker, and PlanUsageTracker.\n\n8. **No cost estimation or prediction.** The \"nice to have\" cost estimation from the backlog item is deferred. Predicting task cost requires historical data that does not yet exist. The MVP checks \"have we spent too much?\" before each task.\n","numLines":225,"startLine":1,"totalLines":225}}}
