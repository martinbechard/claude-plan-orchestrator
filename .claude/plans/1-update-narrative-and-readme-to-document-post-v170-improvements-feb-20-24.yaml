      Design doc: docs/plans/2026-02-24-1-update-narrative-and-readme-to-document-post-v170-improvements-feb-20-24-design.md


      Create docs/narrative/16-failure-awareness.md - Chapter 16 of the narrative
      in the first-person AI narrator voice. Read docs/narrative/15-the-loop-that-wouldnt-stop.md
      for style reference.


      The chapter synthesizes six completed items from Feb 20-24 into the theme of
      "the system learning to detect and communicate its own failure modes":

      - Sandbox permission model completion (two-axis permission gap)

      - Plan-level deadlock detection (failed tasks blocking dependents)

      - Cross-instance agent permission issues

      - Root cause and fix summary in defect completion notifications

      - Cross-project Slack reporting documentation

      - Single-command onboarding documentation


      Read the completed items in docs/completed-backlog/ for details.


      Also update docs/narrative/README.md:

      - Add Chapter 16 to the Document Index table

      - Add Feb 20-24 timeline entries

      - Update line counts to ~5800 (orchestrator) + ~3200 (auto-pipeline)

      - Update completed plans count to reflect current state (~54 completed items)
