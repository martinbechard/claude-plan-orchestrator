    description: "Implement the work item: docs/feature-backlog/1-bulb-feature-request-improve-readme-docs-on-cross-project-slack-defect-repor.md\n\
      Design doc: docs/plans/2026-02-21-1-bulb-feature-request-improve-readme-docs-on-cross-project-slack-defect-repor-design.md\n\
      \nUpdate two files with consumer-facing cross-project reporting documentation:\n\
      \n1. README.md: Expand the existing \"Cross-Instance Collaboration via Slack\"\
      \ section (around line 463) with a new subsection \"Setting Up Cross-Project\
      \ Reporting (Consumer Side)\" that provides:\n   - A brief overview of what\
      \ a consumer project needs to do\n   - A pointer to the detailed setup guide\n\
      \n2. docs/setup-guide.md: Add a new section \"Cross-Project Reporting\" that\
      \ walks through:\n   - Which upstream Slack channels must exist and their naming\
      \ convention (prefix-defects, prefix-features, etc.)\n   - How to invite the\
      \ consumer bot to the upstream channels\n   - How send_defect/send_idea route\
      \ messages via channel_prefix in orchestrator-config.yaml\n   - The agent identity\
      \ protocol that prevents self-loop messages\n   - A quick-start example showing\
      \ a consumer project reporting a defect to an upstream project\n\nFiles: README.md,\
      \ docs/setup-guide.md\n"
